# English translation of the Tripitaka

There are some editions there, but getting the vast amount of data into JSON files will be difficult.

And simply organizing all the different parts is an old problem that others work on. Some progress has been made:

[Conventions of suttracentral.net](https://suttacentral.net/numbering?lang=en)

On this top level we will find three folders:

- vinaya - Vinaya Piṭaka (_Basket of Discipline_)
- sutta - Sūtra Piṭaka or Suttanta Piṭaka (_Basket of Discourse_)
- abhidhamma - Abhidhamma Piṭaka (_Basket of Higher Doctrine_) - 7 books

[bilara-data](https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data) reflects an ongoing translation efford. Maybe it helps
