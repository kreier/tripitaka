(<a href="1001061105.xhtml#chapter1_verse20">Ge 1:20;</a><a href="1001061105-split2.xhtml#chapter2_verse7"> 2:7;</a><a href="1001061108-split31.xhtml#chapter31_verse28"> Nu 31:28;</a><a href="1001061164-split3.xhtml#chapter3_verse20"> 1Pe 3:20</a>; also ftns.) In contrast to the way that the term “soul” is used in many religious contexts, the Bible shows that both <em>neʹphesh</em> and <em>psy·kheʹ,</em> in connection with earthly creatures, refer to that which is material, tangible, visible, and mortal. In this translation, these original-language words have most often been rendered according to their meaning in each context, using such terms as “life,” “creature,” “person,” “one’s whole being,” or simply as a personal pronoun (for example, “I” for “my soul”). In most cases, footnotes give the alternative rendering “soul.” When the term “soul” is used, either in the main text or in footnotes, it should be understood in line with the above explanation. When referring to doing something with one’s whole soul, it means to do it with one’s whole being, wholeheartedly, or with one’s whole life. (<a href="1001061109-split6.xhtml#chapter6_verse5">De 6:5;</a><a href="1001061144-split22.xhtml#chapter22_verse37"> Mt 22:37</a>) In some contexts, these original-language words can be used to refer to the desire or appetite of a living creature.
