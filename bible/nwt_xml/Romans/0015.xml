<level1><h1 id="p388">Chapter 15</h1>
<p><span id="p389" class="sentence">We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves.</span>
<span id="p390" class="sentence">2  Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</span>
<span id="p391" class="sentence">3  For even the Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written: “The reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me.”</span>
<span id="p392" class="sentence">4  For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.</span>
<span id="p393" class="sentence">5  Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had,</span>
<span id="p394" class="sentence">6  so that unitedly you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p395" class="sentence">7  So welcome one another, just as the Christ also welcomed you, with glory to God in view.</span>
<span id="p396" class="sentence">8  For I tell you that Christ became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers,</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">9  and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: “That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations, and to your name I will sing praises.”</span>
<span id="p398" class="sentence">10  And again he says: “Be glad, you nations, with his people.”</span>
<span id="p399" class="sentence">11  And again: “Praise Jehovah, all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.”</span>
<span id="p400" class="sentence">12  And again Isaiah says: “There will be the root of Jesʹse, the one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.”</span>
<span id="p401" class="sentence">13  May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in him, so that you may abound in hope with power of holy spirit.</span>
<span id="p402" class="sentence">14  Now I myself am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are also full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and that you are able to admonish one another.</span>
<span id="p403" class="sentence">15  However, I have written to you more outspokenly on some points, so as to give you another reminder, because of the undeserved kindness given to me from God</span>
<span id="p404" class="sentence">16  for me to be a public servant of Christ Jesus to the nations. I am engaging in the holy work of the good news of God, so that these nations might be an acceptable offering, sanctified with holy spirit.</span>
<span id="p405" class="sentence">17  So I have reason to exult in Christ Jesus over the things pertaining to God.</span>
<span id="p406" class="sentence">18  For I will not presume to speak about anything except what Christ has done through me in order for the nations to be obedient, by my word and deed,</span>
<span id="p407" class="sentence">19  with the power of signs and wonders, with the power of God’s spirit, so that from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Il·lyrʹi·cum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ.</span>
<span id="p408" class="sentence">20  In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where the name of Christ had already been made known, so as not to build on another man’s foundation;</span>
<span id="p409" class="sentence">21  but just as it is written: “Those who received no report about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”</span>
<span id="p410" class="sentence">22  This is also why I was many times hindered from coming to you.</span>
<span id="p411" class="sentence">23  But now I no longer have untouched territory in these regions, and for many years I have longed to come to you.</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">24  Therefore, when I journey to Spain, I hope that I will see you and be accompanied partway there by you after I have first enjoyed your company for a time.</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">25  But now I am about to travel to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones.</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">26  For those in Mac·e·doʹni·a and A·chaʹia have been pleased to share their things by a contribution to the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p415" class="sentence">27  True, they have been pleased to do so, and indeed they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, they also owe it to minister to them with their material things.</span>
<span id="p416" class="sentence">28  So after I have finished with this and have delivered this contribution securely to them, I will depart by way of you for Spain.</span>
<span id="p417" class="sentence">29  Moreover, I know that when I do come to you, I will come with a full measure of blessing from Christ.</span>
<span id="p418" class="sentence">30  Now I urge you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the spirit, that you exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me,</span>
<span id="p419" class="sentence">31  that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Ju·deʹa and that my ministry in behalf of Jerusalem may prove to be acceptable to the holy ones,</span>
<span id="p420" class="sentence">32  so that by God’s will I will come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you.</span>
<span id="p421" class="sentence">33  May the God who gives peace be with all of you. Amen.</span></p></level1>
