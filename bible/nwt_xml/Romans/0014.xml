<level1><h1 id="p364">Chapter 14</h1>
<p><span id="p365" class="sentence">Welcome the man having weaknesses in his faith, but do not pass judgment on differing opinions.</span>
<span id="p366" class="sentence">2  One man has faith to eat everything, but the man who is weak eats only vegetables.</span>
<span id="p367" class="sentence">3  Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating, and let the one not eating not judge the one eating, for God has welcomed him.</span>
<span id="p368" class="sentence">4  Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for Jehovah can make him stand.</span>
<span id="p369" class="sentence">5  One man judges one day as above another; another judges one day the same as all others; let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.</span>
<span id="p370" class="sentence">6  The one who observes the day observes it to Jehovah. Also, the one who eats, eats to Jehovah, for he gives thanks to God; and the one who does not eat does not eat to Jehovah, and yet gives thanks to God.</span>
<span id="p371" class="sentence">7  Not one of us, in fact, lives with regard to himself only, and no one dies with regard to himself only.</span>
<span id="p372" class="sentence">8  For if we live, we live to Jehovah, and if we die, we die to Jehovah. So both if we live and if we die, we belong to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p373" class="sentence">9  For to this end Christ died and came to life again, so that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.</span>
<span id="p374" class="sentence">10  But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you also look down on your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.</span>
<span id="p375" class="sentence">11  For it is written: “‘As surely as I live,’ says Jehovah, ‘to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will make open acknowledgment to God.’”</span>
<span id="p376" class="sentence">12  So, then, each of us will render an account for himself to God.</span>
<span id="p377" class="sentence">13  Therefore, let us not judge one another any longer but, rather, be determined not to put a stumbling block or an obstacle before a brother.</span>
<span id="p378" class="sentence">14  I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; only where a man considers something to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span>
<span id="p379" class="sentence">15  For if your brother is being offended because of food, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not by your food ruin that one for whom Christ died.</span>
<span id="p380" class="sentence">16  Therefore, do not let the good you do be spoken of as bad.</span>
<span id="p381" class="sentence">17  For the Kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking, but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit.</span>
<span id="p382" class="sentence">18  For whoever slaves for Christ in this way is acceptable to God and has approval with men.</span>
<span id="p383" class="sentence">19  So, then, let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up.</span>
<span id="p384" class="sentence">20  Stop tearing down the work of God just for the sake of food. True, all things are clean, but it is detrimental for a man to eat when it will cause stumbling.</span>
<span id="p385" class="sentence">21  It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles.</span>
<span id="p386" class="sentence">22  The faith that you have, keep it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who does not judge himself by what he approves.</span>
<span id="p387" class="sentence">23  But if he has doubts, he is already condemned if he eats, because he does not eat based on faith. Indeed, everything that is not based on faith is sin.</span></p></level1>
