<p><span id="p56" class="sentence">“For look! in those days and in that time,When I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">2  I will also gather together all the nationsAnd bring them down to the Valley of Je·hoshʹa·phat.
I will enter into judgment with them thereIn behalf of my people and my inheritance Israel,For they scattered them among the nations,And they divided up my land among themselves.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">3  For my people they cast lots;They would trade a boy to hire a prostituteAnd sell a girl for wine to drink.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">4  Also, what do you have against me,O Tyre and Siʹdon and all the regions of Phi·lisʹti·a?
Are you repaying me for something?
If you are repaying me,I will swiftly, speedily bring your repayment on your heads.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">5  Because you have taken my silver and gold,And you have brought my finest treasures into your temples;</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">6  And the people of Judah and Jerusalem you have sold to the Greeks,In order to remove them far from their territory;</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">7  Here I am rousing them to come from the place where you sold them,And I will bring your repayment on your heads.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">8  I will sell your sons and daughters into the hand of the people of Judah,And they will sell them to the men of Sheʹba, to a nation far away;For Jehovah himself has spoken it.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">9  Proclaim this among the nations:
‘Prepare for war! Stir up the mighty men!
Let all the soldiers draw near, let them advance!</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">10  Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning shears into spears.
Let the weak one say: “I am powerful.”</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">11  Come and help, all you surrounding nations, assemble together!’”
To that place, O Jehovah, bring down your powerful ones.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">12  “Let the nations be roused and come up to the Valley of Je·hoshʹa·phat;For there I will sit in order to judge all the surrounding nations.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">13  Thrust in a sickle, for the harvest is ripe.
Come down and tread, for the winepress is full.
The vats overflow, for their badness is abundant.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">14  Crowds, crowds are in the valley of the decision,For the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of the decision.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">15  Sun and moon will become dark,And the stars will lose their brightness.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">16  And Jehovah will roar out of Zion,Out of Jerusalem he will raise his voice.
And heaven and earth will rock;But Jehovah will be a refuge for his people,A fortress for the people of Israel.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">17  And you will have to know that I am Jehovah your God, residing in Zion, my holy mountain.
Jerusalem will become a holy place,And strangers will pass through her no more.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">18  In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,The hills will flow with milk,And the streams of Judah will all flow with water.
Out of the house of Jehovah a spring will flow,And it will irrigate the Valley of the Acacia Trees.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">19  But Egypt will become desolate,And Eʹdom will be a desolate wilderness,Because of the violence done to the people of Judah,In whose land they shed innocent blood.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">20  But Judah will always be inhabited,And Jerusalem to generation after generation.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">21  I will consider innocent their blood that I had not considered innocent;And Jehovah will reside in Zion.”</span></p></level1>
