<level1><h1 id="p22">Chapter 2</h1>
<p><span id="p23" class="sentence">“Blow a horn in Zion!
Shout a war cry in my holy mountain.
Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,For the day of Jehovah is coming! It is near!</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">2  It is a day of darkness and gloom,A day of clouds and thick gloom,Like light of dawn spreading out on the mountains.
There is a people numerous and mighty;Never before has there been one like it,And never again will there be anotherThrough the years of all generations.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">3  Ahead of it a fire devours,And behind it a flame consumes.
The land ahead of it is like the garden of Eʹden,But behind it is a desolate wilderness,And nothing can escape.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">4  Its appearance is like the appearance of horses,And they run like warhorses.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">5  The sound is like that of chariots as they leap on the mountaintops,Like the crackling of a blazing fire that consumes stubble.
It is like a mighty people drawn up in battle formation.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">6  Because of them, peoples will be in anguish.
Every face will grow flushed.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">7  They charge like warriors,They scale a wall like soldiers,Each keeps to his own course,And they do not swerve from their paths.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">8  They do not shove one another;Each man advances in his course.
If the weapons cause some to fall,The others do not break ranks.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">9  Into the city they rush, on the wall they run.
Onto the houses they climb, through the windows they enter like a thief.</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">10  Before them the land trembles and the heavens rock.
Sun and moon have become dark,And the stars have lost their brightness.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">11  Jehovah will raise his voice before his army, for his camp is very numerous.
For the one carrying out His word is mighty;For the day of Jehovah is great and very awe-inspiring.
Who can endure it?”</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">12  “Yet even now,” declares Jehovah, “return to me with all your hearts,With fasting and weeping and wailing.</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">13  Rip apart your hearts, and not your garments,And return to Jehovah your God,For he is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love,And he will reconsider the calamity.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">14  Who knows whether he will turn back and reconsiderAnd leave behind a blessing,A grain offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God?</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">15  Blow a horn in Zion!
Proclaim a fast; call for a solemn assembly.</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">16  Gather the people; sanctify the congregation.
Collect the old men; gather the children and nursing infants.
Let the bridegroom go out from his inner chamber, and the bride from her bridal chamber.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">17  Between the porch and the altarLet the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep and say:
‘Do feel pity, O Jehovah, for your people;Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn,Letting the nations rule over them.
Why should the peoples say, “Where is their God?”’</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">18  Then Jehovah will be zealous for his landAnd show compassion on his people.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">19  Jehovah will answer his people:
‘Here I am sending to you grain and new wine and oil,And you will be fully satisfied;I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">20  I will drive the northerner far away from you;I will disperse him to a dry and desolate wasteland,With his vanguard toward the eastern seaAnd his rear guard toward the western sea.
The foul smell from him will ascend,The stench from him will keep ascending;For He will do great things.’</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">21  Do not be afraid, O land.
Be joyful and rejoice, for Jehovah will do great things.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">22  Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field,For the pastures of the wilderness will become green,And the trees will bear fruit;The fig tree and the vine must give their full yield.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">23  You sons of Zion, be joyful and rejoice in Jehovah your God;For he will give you the autumn rain in the right amount,And he will send upon you a downpour,The autumn rain and the spring rain, as before.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">24  The threshing floors will be full of pure grain,And the presses will overflow with new wine and oil.</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">25  And I will make compensation to you for the yearsThat the swarming locust, the unwinged locust, the voracious locust, and the devouring locust have eaten,My great army that I sent among you.</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">26  You will surely eat to satisfaction,And you will praise the name of Jehovah your God,Who has done wonders in your behalf;My people will never again be put to shame.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">27  And you will have to know that I am in the midst of IsraelAnd that I am Jehovah your God—there is no other!
My people will never again be put to shame.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">28  After that I will pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh,And your sons and your daughters will prophesy,Your old men will dream dreams,And your young men will see visions.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">29  And even on my male slaves and female slavesI will pour out my spirit in those days.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">30  And I will give wonders in the heavens and on the earth,Blood and fire and columns of smoke.</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">31  The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into bloodBefore the coming of the great and awe-inspiring day of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">32  And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved;For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, just as Jehovah has said,The survivors whom Jehovah calls.”</span></p></level1>
