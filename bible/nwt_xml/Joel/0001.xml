<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pe·thuʹel:</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  “Hear this, you elders,And pay attention, all you inhabitants of the land.
Has anything like this happened in your daysOr in the days of your forefathers?</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  Tell about it to your sons,And let your sons tell about it to their sons,And their sons to the next generation.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  What was left by the devouring locust, the swarming locust has eaten;And what was left by the swarming locust, the unwinged locust has eaten;And what the unwinged locust has left, the voracious locust has eaten.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
Wail, all you wine drinkers,Because the sweet wine has been taken from your mouths.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  For a nation has come up into my land, mighty and without number.
Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its jaws are those of a lion.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  It has devastated my vine and turned my fig tree into a stump,Stripping them completely bare and tossing them aside,Leaving their twigs white.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  Wail as a virgin wearing sackcloth doesFor the bridegroom of her youth.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  Grain offering and drink offering have ceased from the house of Jehovah;The priests, the ministers of Jehovah, are in mourning.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  The field has been devastated, the ground mourns;For the grain has been devastated, the new wine has dried up, the oil has failed.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  Farmers are dismayed, vinedressers wail,Because of the wheat and the barley;For the harvest of the field has perished.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  The vine has dried up,The fig tree has withered.
The pomegranate, the palm, and the apple,All the trees of the field have dried up;For joy has turned to shame among the people.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests;Wail, you ministers of the altar.
Come in and spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God;For grain offering and drink offering have been withheld from the house of your God.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  Proclaim a fast; call for a solemn assembly.
Gather the elders together, with all the inhabitants of the land,To the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah for help.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  Woe because of the day!
For the day of Jehovah is near,And it will come like a destruction from the Almighty!</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  Has not food been taken from before our very eyes,And rejoicing and joy from the house of our God?</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  The seeds have shriveled under their shovels.
Storehouses are desolate.
Granaries have been torn down, for the grain has dried up.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  Even the livestock groan!
The herds of cattle wander in confusion, for they have no pasture!
And the flocks of sheep bear the punishment.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  To you, O Jehovah, I will call;For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,And a flame has consumed all the trees of the field.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  Even the wild beasts long for you,Because the streams of water have dried upAnd fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.”</span></p></level1>
