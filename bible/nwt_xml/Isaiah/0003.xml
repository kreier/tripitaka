<level1><h1 id="p56">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p57" class="sentence">For look! the true Lord, Jehovah of armies,Is removing from Jerusalem and Judah every kind of support and supply,All support of bread and water,</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">2  Mighty man and warrior,Judge and prophet, diviner and elder,</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">3  Chief of 50, dignitary, and adviser,The expert magician and the skilled charmer.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">4  I will make boys their princes,And the unstable will rule over them.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">5  The people will oppress one another,Each one his fellow man.
The boy will assault the old man,And the lightly esteemed one will defy the respected one.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">6  Each one will take hold of his brother in his father’s house and say:
“You have a cloak—you be our commander.
Take charge of this overthrown pile of ruins.”</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">7  But he will protest in that day:
“I will not be your wound dresser;I have no food or clothing in my house.
Do not make me commander over the people.”</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">8  For Jerusalem has stumbled,And Judah has fallen,Because in word and deed they are against Jehovah;They behave defiantly in his glorious presence.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">9  The expression of their faces testifies against them,And they proclaim their sin like Sodʹom;They do not try to hide it.
Woe to them, for they are bringing disaster on themselves!</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">10  Tell the righteous that it will go well for them;They will be rewarded for what they do.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">11  Woe to the wicked one!
Disaster will befall him,For what his hands have done will be done to him!</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">12  As for my people, their taskmasters are abusive,And women rule over them.
My people, your leaders are causing you to wander,And they confuse the direction of your paths.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">13  Jehovah is taking his position to accuse;He is standing up to pass sentence on peoples.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">14  Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people.
“You have burned down the vineyard,And what you have stolen from the poor is in your houses.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">15  How dare you crush my peopleAnd grind the faces of the poor in the dirt?” declares the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">16  Jehovah says: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,Walking with their heads high,Flirting with their eyes, skipping along,Making a tinkling sound with their anklets,</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">17  Jehovah will also strike the head of the daughters of Zion with scabs,And Jehovah will make their forehead bare.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">18  In that day Jehovah will take away the beauty of their bangles,The headbands and the crescent-shaped ornaments,</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">19  The earrings, the bracelets, and the veils,</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">20  The headdresses, the ankle chains, and the breastbands,The perfume receptacles and the charms,</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">21  The finger rings and the nose rings,</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">22  The ceremonial robes, the overtunics, the cloaks, and the purses,</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">23  The hand mirrors and the linen garments,The turbans and the veils.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">24  Instead of balsam oil, there will be a rotten smell;Instead of a belt, a rope;Instead of a beautiful hairstyle, baldness;Instead of a rich garment, a garment of sackcloth;And a brand mark instead of beauty.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">25  By the sword your men will fall,And your mighty men in battle.</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">26  Her entrances will mourn and grieve,And she will sit on the ground desolate.”</span></p></level1>
