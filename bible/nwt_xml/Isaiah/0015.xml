<p><span id="p322" class="sentence">A pronouncement against Moʹab:
Because it has been devastated in a night,Ar of Moʹab has been silenced.
Because it has been devastated in a night,Kir of Moʹab has been silenced.</span>
<span id="p323" class="sentence">2  He has gone up to the House and to Diʹbon,To the high places to weep.
Moʹab wails over Neʹbo and over Medʹe·ba.
Every head is shaved bald, every beard is clipped.</span>
<span id="p324" class="sentence">3  In its streets they have put on sackcloth.
On their roofs and in their public squares they all wail;They go down weeping.</span>
<span id="p325" class="sentence">4  Heshʹbon and E·le·aʹleh cry out;Their voice is heard as far as Jaʹhaz.
That is why the armed men of Moʹab keep shouting.
He is trembling.</span>
<span id="p326" class="sentence">5  My heart cries out over Moʹab.
Its fugitives have fled as far as Zoʹar and Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah.
On the ascent of Luʹhith they weep as they go up;On the way to Hor·o·naʹim they cry out over the catastrophe.</span>
<span id="p327" class="sentence">6  For the waters of Nimʹrim are desolate;The green grass has dried up,The grass is gone and nothing green is left.</span>
<span id="p328" class="sentence">7  That is why they are carrying away what is left of their stores and their riches;They are crossing the valley of poplars.</span>
<span id="p329" class="sentence">8  For the outcry echoes throughout the territory of Moʹab.
The wailing reaches to Eg·laʹim;The wailing reaches to Beʹer-eʹlim.</span>
<span id="p330" class="sentence">9  For the waters of Diʹmon are full of blood,And I have more in store for Diʹmon:
A lion for those of Moʹab who escapeAnd for those remaining in the land.</span></p></level1>
