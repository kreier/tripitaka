<level1><h1 id="p402">Chapter 21</h1>
<p><span id="p403" class="sentence">A pronouncement against the wilderness of the sea:
It is coming like storm winds that sweep through in the south,From the wilderness, from a fearsome land.</span>
<span id="p404" class="sentence">2  A harsh vision has been told to me:
The treacherous one is acting treacherously,And the destroyer is destroying.
Go up, O Eʹlam! Lay siege, O Meʹdi·a!
I will put an end to all the sighing she caused.</span>
<span id="p405" class="sentence">3  That is why I am in great anguish.
Convulsions have seized me,Like those of a woman giving birth.
I am too distressed to hear;I am too disturbed to see.</span>
<span id="p406" class="sentence">4  My heart falters; I shudder in terror.
The twilight I longed for makes me tremble.</span>
<span id="p407" class="sentence">5  Set the table and arrange the seats!
Eat and drink!
Get up, you princes, anoint the shield!</span>
<span id="p408" class="sentence">6  For this is what Jehovah said to me:
“Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.”</span>
<span id="p409" class="sentence">7  And he saw a war chariot with a team of horses,A war chariot of donkeys,A war chariot of camels.
He watched carefully, with great attentiveness.</span>
<span id="p410" class="sentence">8  Then he called out like a lion:
“Upon the watchtower, O Jehovah, I am standing constantly by day,And I am stationed at my guardpost every night.</span>
<span id="p411" class="sentence">9  Look at what is coming:
Men in a war chariot with a team of horses!”
Then he spoke up and said:
“She has fallen! Babylon has fallen!
All the graven images of her gods he has shattered to the ground!”</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">10  O my people who have been threshed,The product of my threshing floor,I have reported to you what I have heard from Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel.</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">11  A pronouncement against Duʹmah:
Someone is calling out to me from Seʹir:
“Watchman, what of the night?
Watchman, what of the night?”</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">12  The watchman said:
“The morning is coming, and also the night.
If you would inquire, inquire.
Come again!”</span>
<span id="p415" class="sentence">13  A pronouncement against the desert plain:
In the forest in the desert plain you will spend the night,O caravans of Deʹdan.</span>
<span id="p416" class="sentence">14  Bring water to meet the thirsty one,You inhabitants of the land of Teʹma,And bring bread for the one fleeing.</span>
<span id="p417" class="sentence">15  For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword,From the bent bow, and from the cruelty of the war.</span>
<span id="p418" class="sentence">16  For this is what Jehovah said to me: “Within one year, like the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Keʹdar will come to an end.</span>
<span id="p419" class="sentence">17  The remaining bowmen of the warriors of Keʹdar will be few, for Jehovah the God of Israel has spoken.”</span></p></level1>
