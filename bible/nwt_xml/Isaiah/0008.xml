<level1><h1 id="p161">Chapter 8</h1>
<p><span id="p162" class="sentence">Jehovah said to me: “Take a large tablet and write on it with an ordinary stylus, ‘Maʹher-shalʹal-hash-baz.’</span>
<span id="p163" class="sentence">2  And let me have it confirmed in writing by faithful witnesses, U·riʹah the priest and Zech·a·riʹah the son of Je·ber·e·chiʹah.”</span>
<span id="p164" class="sentence">3  Then I had relations with the prophetess, and she became pregnant and in time gave birth to a son. Jehovah then said to me: “Name him Maʹher-shalʹal-hash-baz,</span>
<span id="p165" class="sentence">4  for before the boy knows how to call out, ‘My father!’ and ‘My mother!’ the resources of Damascus and the spoil of Sa·marʹi·a will be carried away before the king of As·syrʹi·a.”</span>
<span id="p166" class="sentence">5  Jehovah spoke to me again:</span>
<span id="p167" class="sentence">6  “Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of the Shi·loʹahAnd they rejoice over Reʹzin and the son of Rem·a·liʹah,</span>
<span id="p168" class="sentence">7  Therefore look! Jehovah will bring against themThe mighty and vast waters of the River,The king of As·syrʹi·a and all his glory.
He will come up over all his streambedsAnd overflow all his banks</span>
<span id="p169" class="sentence">8  And sweep through Judah.
He will flood and pass through, reaching to the neck;His outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land,O Im·manʹu·el!”</span>
<span id="p170" class="sentence">9  Cause harm, you peoples, but you will be shattered to pieces.
Listen, all you from distant parts of the earth!
Prepare for battle, but you will be shattered to pieces!
Prepare for battle, but you will be shattered to pieces!</span>
<span id="p171" class="sentence">10  Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted!
Say what you like, but it will not succeed,For God is with us!</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">11  With his strong hand on me, this is what Jehovah said to me to warn me away from following the course of this people:</span>
<span id="p173" class="sentence">12  “You should not call a conspiracy what this people calls a conspiracy!
Do not fear what they fear;Do not tremble at it.</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">13  Jehovah of armies—he is the One you should regard as holy,He is the One you should fear,And he is the One who should cause you to tremble.”</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">14  He will become as a sanctuary,But as a stone to strike againstAnd as a rock to stumble overTo both houses of Israel,As a trap and a snareTo the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">15  Many of them will stumble and fall and be broken;They will be ensnared and caught.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">16  Wrap up the written confirmation;Seal up the law among my disciples!</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">17  I will keep in expectation of Jehovah, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">18  Look! I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are as signs and as miracles in Israel from Jehovah of armies, who resides on Mount Zion.</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">19  And if they say to you: “Inquire of the spirit mediums or of the fortune-tellers who chirp and mutter,” is it not of their God that a people should inquire? Should they inquire of the dead in behalf of the living?</span>
<span id="p181" class="sentence">20  Instead, they should inquire of the law and of the written confirmation!
When they do not speak according to this word, they have no light.</span>
<span id="p182" class="sentence">21  And each one will pass through the land afflicted and hungry; and because he is hungry and indignant, he will curse his king and his God as he looks upward.</span>
<span id="p183" class="sentence">22  Then he will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness, obscurity and hard times, gloom and no brightness.</span></p></level1>
