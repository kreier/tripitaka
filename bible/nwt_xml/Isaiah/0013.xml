<p><span id="p266" class="sentence">A pronouncement against Babylon that Isaiah the son of Aʹmoz saw in vision:</span>
<span id="p267" class="sentence">2  “Raise up a signal on a mountain of bare rocks.
Call out to them, wave your hand,So that they may come into the entrances of the nobles.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">3  I have issued the command to those whom I have appointed.
I have summoned my warriors to express my anger,My proudly exultant ones.</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">4  Listen! A crowd in the mountains;It sounds like a numerous people!
Listen! The uproar of kingdoms,Of nations gathered together!
Jehovah of armies is mustering the army for war.</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">5  They are coming from a distant land,From the extremity of the heavens,Jehovah and the weapons of his wrath,To bring ruin to all the earth.</span>
<span id="p271" class="sentence">6  Wail, for the day of Jehovah is near!
It will come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span>
<span id="p272" class="sentence">7  That is why all hands will go limp,And every man’s heart will melt with fear.</span>
<span id="p273" class="sentence">8  The people are panic-stricken.
They are seized with convulsions and pain,Like a woman in labor.
They look at one another in horror,With faces inflamed by anguish.</span>
<span id="p274" class="sentence">9  Look! The day of Jehovah is coming,Cruel both with fury and with burning anger,To make the land an object of horror,And to annihilate the land’s sinners from it.</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">10  For the stars of the heavens and their constellationsWill not give off their light;The sun will be dark when it rises,And the moon will not shed its light.</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">11  I will call the inhabited earth to account for its badness,And the wicked for their error.
I will put an end to the pride of the presumptuous,And I will humble the haughtiness of tyrants.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">12  I will make mortal man scarcer than refined gold,And humans scarcer than the gold of Oʹphir.</span>
<span id="p278" class="sentence">13  That is why I will make the heavens tremble,And the earth will be shaken out of its placeAt the fury of Jehovah of armies in the day of his burning anger.</span>
<span id="p279" class="sentence">14  Like a hunted gazelle and like a flock with no one to gather them,Each will return to his own people;Each will flee to his own land.</span>
<span id="p280" class="sentence">15  Whoever is found will be pierced through,And whoever is caught will fall by the sword.</span>
<span id="p281" class="sentence">16  Their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes,Their houses will be looted,And their wives will be raped.</span>
<span id="p282" class="sentence">17  Here I am raising up against them the Medes,Who regard silver as nothingAnd who take no delight in gold.</span>
<span id="p283" class="sentence">18  Their bows will shatter young men;They will show no pity on the fruit of the wombNor mercy to children.</span>
<span id="p284" class="sentence">19  And Babylon, the most glorious of kingdoms,The beauty and the pride of the Chal·deʹans,Will be like Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah when God overthrew them.</span>
<span id="p285" class="sentence">20  She will never be inhabited,Nor will she be a place to reside in throughout all generations.
No Arab will pitch his tent there,And no shepherds will rest their flocks there.</span>
<span id="p286" class="sentence">21  The desert creatures will lie down there;Their houses will be filled with eagle owls.
The ostriches will reside there,And wild goats will skip about there.</span>
<span id="p287" class="sentence">22  Howling creatures will cry out in her towers,And jackals in her luxurious palaces.
Her time is near, and her days will not be prolonged.”</span></p></level1>
