<level1><h1 id="p894">Chapter 43</h1>
<p><span id="p895" class="sentence">Now this is what Jehovah says,Your Creator, O Jacob, the One who formed you, O Israel:
“Do not be afraid, for I have repurchased you.
I have called you by your name.
You belong to me.</span>
<span id="p896" class="sentence">2  When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,And through the rivers, they will not flood over you.
When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,Nor will the flame singe you.</span>
<span id="p897" class="sentence">3  For I am Jehovah your God,The Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
I have given Egypt as a ransom for you,E·thi·oʹpi·a and Seʹba in exchange for you.</span>
<span id="p898" class="sentence">4  For you became precious in my eyes,You were honored, and I have loved you.
So I will give people in place of youAnd nations in exchange for your life.</span>
<span id="p899" class="sentence">5  Do not be afraid, for I am with you.
I will bring your offspring from the eastAnd gather you together from the west.</span>
<span id="p900" class="sentence">6  I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’
And to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.
Bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth,</span>
<span id="p901" class="sentence">7  Everyone who is called by my nameAnd whom I created for my own glory,Whom I have formed and made.’</span>
<span id="p902" class="sentence">8  Bring out a people who are blind, though they have eyes,And who are deaf, though they have ears.</span>
<span id="p903" class="sentence">9  Let all the nations assemble in one place,And let the peoples be gathered together.
Who among them can tell this?
Or can they cause us to hear the first things?
Let them present their witnesses to prove themselves right,Or let them hear and say, ‘It is the truth!’”</span>
<span id="p904" class="sentence">10  “You are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah,“Yes, my servant whom I have chosen,So that you may know and have faith in meAnd understand that I am the same One.
Before me no God was formed,And after me there has been none.</span>
<span id="p905" class="sentence">11  I—I am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.”</span>
<span id="p906" class="sentence">12  “I am the One who declared and saved and made knownWhen there was no foreign god among you.
So you are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God.</span>
<span id="p907" class="sentence">13  Also, I am always the same One;And no one can snatch anything out of my hand.
When I act, who can prevent it?”</span>
<span id="p908" class="sentence">14  This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:
“For your sakes I will send to Babylon and bring down all the bars of the gates,And the Chal·deʹans, in their ships, will cry out in distress.</span>
<span id="p909" class="sentence">15  I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.”</span>
<span id="p910" class="sentence">16  This is what Jehovah says,The One making a way through the seaAnd a path even through turbulent waters,</span>
<span id="p911" class="sentence">17  The One who draws out the war chariot and the horse,The army together with the mighty warriors:
“They will lie down and not get up.
They will be extinguished, snuffed out like a burning wick.”</span>
<span id="p912" class="sentence">18  “Do not remember the former things,And do not dwell on the past.</span>
<span id="p913" class="sentence">19  Look! I am doing something new;Even now it is springing up.
Do you not recognize it?
I will make a way through the wildernessAnd rivers through the desert.</span>
<span id="p914" class="sentence">20  The wild beast of the field will honor me,The jackals and the ostriches,For I provide water in the wilderness,Rivers in the desert,For my people, my chosen one, to drink,</span>
<span id="p915" class="sentence">21  The people whom I formed for myselfSo that they might declare my praise.</span>
<span id="p916" class="sentence">22  But you have not called on me, O Jacob,Because you grew weary of me, O Israel.</span>
<span id="p917" class="sentence">23  You have not brought me sheep for your whole burnt offeringsOr glorified me with your sacrifices.
I have not compelled you to bring me a gift,Nor have I made you weary by demanding frankincense.</span>
<span id="p918" class="sentence">24  You did not buy me sweet cane with your money,And with the fat of your sacrifices you did not satisfy me.
Instead, you have burdened me with your sinsAnd made me weary with your errors.</span>
<span id="p919" class="sentence">25  I, I am the One who is blotting out your transgressions for my own sake,And I will not remember your sins.</span>
<span id="p920" class="sentence">26  Remind me; let us bring our case against each other;Tell your side of it to prove you are in the right.</span>
<span id="p921" class="sentence">27  Your first forefather sinned,And your own spokesmen have rebelled against me.</span>
<span id="p922" class="sentence">28  So I will profane the princes of the holy place,And I will give Jacob over to destructionAnd subject Israel to insulting words.</span></p></level1>
