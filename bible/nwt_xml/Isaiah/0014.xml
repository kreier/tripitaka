<level1><h1 id="p288">Chapter 14</h1>
<p><span id="p289" class="sentence">For Jehovah will show mercy to Jacob, and he will again choose Israel. He will settle them in their land, and the foreign residents will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.</span>
<span id="p290" class="sentence">2  And peoples will take them and bring them to their own place, and the house of Israel will possess them as male and female servants in Jehovah’s land; and they will be the captors of those who held them captive, and they will have in subjection those who were forcing them to work.</span>
<span id="p291" class="sentence">3  In the day when Jehovah gives you rest from your pain and from your turmoil and from the hard slavery imposed on you,</span>
<span id="p292" class="sentence">4  you will recite this proverb against the king of Babylon:
“How the one forcing others to work has met his end!
How the oppression has ended!</span>
<span id="p293" class="sentence">5  Jehovah has broken the rod of the wicked,The staff of the rulers,</span>
<span id="p294" class="sentence">6  The one furiously striking peoples with unceasing blows,The one angrily subduing nations with relentless persecution.</span>
<span id="p295" class="sentence">7  The whole earth now rests, free of disturbance.
People cry out for joy.</span>
<span id="p296" class="sentence">8  Even the juniper trees rejoice over you,Along with the cedars of Lebʹa·non.
They say, ‘Ever since you have fallen,No woodcutter comes up against us.’</span>
<span id="p297" class="sentence">9  Even the Grave underneath is stirred upTo meet you when you come.
Because of you, it awakens those powerless in death,All the oppressive leaders of the earth.
It makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones.</span>
<span id="p298" class="sentence">10  All of them speak up and say to you,‘Have you also become weak like us?
Have you become like us?</span>
<span id="p299" class="sentence">11  Down to the Grave your pride has been brought,The sound of your stringed instruments.
Maggots are spread beneath you as a bed,And worms are your covering.’</span>
<span id="p300" class="sentence">12  How you have fallen from heaven,O shining one, son of the dawn!
How you have been cut down to the earth,You who vanquished nations!</span>
<span id="p301" class="sentence">13  You said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to the heavens.
Above the stars of God I will lift up my throne,And I will sit down on the mountain of meeting,In the remotest parts of the north.</span>
<span id="p302" class="sentence">14  I will go up above the tops of the clouds;I will make myself resemble the Most High.’</span>
<span id="p303" class="sentence">15  Instead, you will be brought down to the Grave,To the remotest parts of the pit.</span>
<span id="p304" class="sentence">16  Those seeing you will stare at you;They will closely examine you, saying,‘Is this the man who was shaking the earth,Who made kingdoms tremble,</span>
<span id="p305" class="sentence">17  Who made the inhabited earth like the wildernessAnd overthrew its cities,Who refused to let his prisoners go home?’</span>
<span id="p306" class="sentence">18  All other kings of the nations,Yes, all of them, lie down in glory,Each one in his own tomb.</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">19  But you are discarded without a grave,Like a detested sprout,Clothed with the slain who were stabbed with the sword,Who go down to the stones of a pit,Like a carcass trampled underfoot.</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">20  You will not join them in a grave,For you destroyed your own land,You killed your own people.
The offspring of evildoers will never again be named.</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">21  Prepare a slaughtering block for his sonsBecause of the guilt of their forefathers,So that they will not rise up and take over the earthAnd fill the land with their cities.”</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">22  “I will rise up against them,” declares Jehovah of armies.
“And I will wipe out from Babylon name and remnant and descendants and posterity,” declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">23  “And I will make her a possession of porcupines and a region of marshes, and I will sweep her with the broom of annihilation,” declares Jehovah of armies.</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">24  Jehovah of armies has sworn:
“Just as I have intended, so it will occur,And just as I have decided, that is what will come true.</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">25  I will crush the As·syrʹi·an in my land,And I will trample him on my mountains.
His yoke will be removed from them,And his load will be removed from their shoulder.”</span>
<span id="p314" class="sentence">26  This is what has been decided against all the earth,And this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations.</span>
<span id="p315" class="sentence">27  For Jehovah of armies has decided,And who can thwart it?
His hand is stretched out,And who can turn it back?</span>
<span id="p316" class="sentence">28  In the year that King Aʹhaz died, this pronouncement was made:</span>
<span id="p317" class="sentence">29  “Do not rejoice, Phi·lisʹti·a, any of you,Just because the staff of the one striking you has been broken.
For from the root of the serpent will come a poisonous snake,And its offspring will be a flying fiery snake.</span>
<span id="p318" class="sentence">30  While the firstborn of the lowly feedAnd the poor lie down in security,I will put your root to death with famine,And what is left of you will be killed.</span>
<span id="p319" class="sentence">31  Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city!
All of you will lose heart, O Phi·lisʹti·a!
For a smoke is coming from the north,And there are no stragglers in his ranks.”</span>
<span id="p320" class="sentence">32  How should they answer the messengers of the nation?
That Jehovah has laid the foundation of Zion,And that the lowly ones of his people will take refuge in her.</span></p></level1>
