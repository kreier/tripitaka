<level1><h1 id="p952">Chapter 45</h1>
<p><span id="p953" class="sentence">This is what Jehovah says to his anointed one, to Cyrus,Whose right hand I have taken hold ofTo subdue nations before him,To disarm kings,To open before him the double doors,So that the gates will not be shut:</span>
<span id="p954" class="sentence">2  “Before you I will go,And the hills I will level.
The copper doors I will break in pieces,And the iron bars I will cut down.</span>
<span id="p955" class="sentence">3  I will give you the treasures in the darknessAnd the hidden treasures in the concealed places,So that you may know that I am Jehovah,The God of Israel, who is calling you by your name.</span>
<span id="p956" class="sentence">4  For the sake of my servant Jacob and of Israel my chosen one,I am calling you by your name.
I am giving you a name of honor, although you did not know me.</span>
<span id="p957" class="sentence">5  I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.
There is no God except me.
I will strengthen you, although you did not know me,</span>
<span id="p958" class="sentence">6  In order that people may knowFrom the rising of the sun to its settingThat there is none besides me.
I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.</span>
<span id="p959" class="sentence">7  I form light and create darkness,I make peace and create calamity;I, Jehovah, am doing all these things.</span>
<span id="p960" class="sentence">8  You heavens, rain down from above;Let the clouds pour down righteousness.
Let the earth open up and be fruitful with salvation,And let it cause righteousness to spring up at the same time.
I, Jehovah, have created it.”</span>
<span id="p961" class="sentence">9  Woe to the one who contends with his Maker,For he is just an earthenware fragmentAmong the other earthenware fragments lying on the ground!
Should the clay say to the Potter: “What are you making?”
Or should your work say: “He has no hands”?</span>
<span id="p962" class="sentence">10  Woe to the one who says to a father: “What do you become father to?”
And to a woman: “What are you giving birth to?”</span>
<span id="p963" class="sentence">11  This is what Jehovah says, the Holy One of Israel, the One who formed him:
“Would you question me about the things comingAnd command me about my sons and the works of my hands?</span>
<span id="p964" class="sentence">12  I made the earth and created man on it.
I stretched out the heavens with my own hands,And I give orders to all their army.”</span>
<span id="p965" class="sentence">13  “I have raised up a man in righteousness,And I will make all his ways straight.
He is the one who will build my cityAnd set my exiles free without a price or a bribe,” says Jehovah of armies.</span>
<span id="p966" class="sentence">14  This is what Jehovah says:
“The profit of Egypt and the merchandise of E·thi·oʹpi·a and the Sa·beʹans, tall of stature,Will come over to you and become yours.
They will walk behind you in chains.
They will come over and bow down to you.
To you they will say in prayer, ‘Surely God is with you,And there is no one else; there is no other God.’”</span>
<span id="p967" class="sentence">15  Truly you are a God who conceals himself,O God of Israel, the Savior.</span>
<span id="p968" class="sentence">16  They will all be put to shame and be humiliated;The makers of idols will all go off in disgrace.</span>
<span id="p969" class="sentence">17  But Israel will be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation.
You will not be put to shame or disgraced for all eternity.</span>
<span id="p970" class="sentence">18  For this is what Jehovah says,The Creator of the heavens, the true God,The One who formed the earth, its Maker who firmly established it,Who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited:
“I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.</span>
<span id="p971" class="sentence">19  I did not speak in a concealed place, in a land of darkness;I did not say to the offspring of Jacob,‘Seek me simply for nothing.’
I am Jehovah, who speaks what is righteous and declares what is upright.</span>
<span id="p972" class="sentence">20  Gather together and come.
Approach together, you escapees from the nations.
They know nothing, those who carry around carved imagesAnd pray to a god that cannot save them.</span>
<span id="p973" class="sentence">21  Make your report, present your case.
Let them consult together in unity.
Who foretold this long agoAnd declared it from times past?
Is it not I, Jehovah?
There is no other God but me;A righteous God and a Savior, there is none besides me.</span>
<span id="p974" class="sentence">22  Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth,For I am God, and there is no one else.</span>
<span id="p975" class="sentence">23  By myself I have sworn;The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness,And it will not return:
To me every knee will bend,Every tongue will swear loyalty</span>
<span id="p976" class="sentence">24  And say, ‘Surely in Jehovah are true righteousness and strength.
All those enraged against him will come before him in shame.</span>
<span id="p977" class="sentence">25  In Jehovah all the offspring of Israel will prove to be right,And in him they will make their boast.’”</span></p></level1>
