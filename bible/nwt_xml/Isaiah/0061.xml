<p><span id="p1251" class="sentence">The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me,Because Jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek.
He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,To proclaim liberty to the captivesAnd the wide opening of the eyes to the prisoners,</span>
<span id="p1252" class="sentence">2  To proclaim the year of Jehovah’s goodwillAnd the day of vengeance of our God,To comfort all who mourn,</span>
<span id="p1253" class="sentence">3  To provide for those mourning over Zion,To give them a headdress instead of ashes,The oil of exultation instead of mourning,The garment of praise instead of a despondent spirit.
And they will be called big trees of righteousness,The planting of Jehovah, in order to glorify him.</span>
<span id="p1254" class="sentence">4  They will rebuild the ancient ruins;They will raise up the desolated places of the past,And they will restore the devastated cities,The places that lay desolate for generation after generation.</span>
<span id="p1255" class="sentence">5  “Strangers will stand and shepherd your flocks,And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.</span>
<span id="p1256" class="sentence">6  As for you, you will be called the priests of Jehovah;They will call you the ministers of our God.
You will eat the resources of the nations,And about their glory you will boast.</span>
<span id="p1257" class="sentence">7  Instead of shame you will have a double portion,And instead of humiliation they will shout joyfully over their share.
Yes, they will possess a double portion in their land.
Everlasting rejoicing will be theirs.</span>
<span id="p1258" class="sentence">8  For I, Jehovah, love justice;I hate robbery and unrighteousness.
I will faithfully give them their wages,And I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</span>
<span id="p1259" class="sentence">9  Their offspring will be known among the nationsAnd their descendants among the peoples.
All who see them will recognize them,That they are the offspring whom Jehovah has blessed.”</span>
<span id="p1260" class="sentence">10  I will greatly exult in Jehovah.
My whole being will rejoice in my God.
For he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;He has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness,Just like a bridegroom who wears a turban like that of a priest,And like a bride who adorns herself with her ornaments.</span>
<span id="p1261" class="sentence">11  For as the earth brings forth its sproutsAnd as the garden makes what is sown in it sprout,So will the Sovereign Lord JehovahCause righteousness and praise to sprout before all the nations.</span></p></level1>
