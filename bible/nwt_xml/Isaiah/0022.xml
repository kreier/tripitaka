<level1><h1 id="p420">Chapter 22</h1>
<p><span id="p421" class="sentence">A pronouncement about the Valley of Vision:
What is the matter with you that you have all gone up to the roofs?</span>
<span id="p422" class="sentence">2  You were full of turmoil,A boisterous city, an exultant town.
Your slain were not slain with the sword,Nor did they die in battle.</span>
<span id="p423" class="sentence">3  All your dictators have fled together.
They were taken prisoner without need of a bow.
All who were found were taken prisoner,Even though they had fled far away.</span>
<span id="p424" class="sentence">4  That is why I said: “Turn your eyes away from me,And I will weep bitterly.
Do not insist on comforting meOver the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span>
<span id="p425" class="sentence">5  For it is a day of confusion and of defeat and of panic,From the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,In the Valley of Vision.
There is a demolishing of the wallAnd a cry to the mountain.</span>
<span id="p426" class="sentence">6  Eʹlam picks up the quiverWith manned chariots and horses,And Kir uncovers the shield.</span>
<span id="p427" class="sentence">7  Your choicest valleysWill become full of war chariots,And the horses will take their positions at the gate,</span>
<span id="p428" class="sentence">8  And the screen of Judah will be removed.
“In that day you will look toward the armory of the House of the Forest,</span>
<span id="p429" class="sentence">9  and you will see the many breaches of the City of David. And you will collect the waters of the lower pool.</span>
<span id="p430" class="sentence">10  You will count the houses of Jerusalem, and you will pull down the houses to reinforce the wall.</span>
<span id="p431" class="sentence">11  And you will make a basin between the two walls for the water of the old pool, but you will not look to its Grand Maker, and you will not see the One who formed it long ago.</span>
<span id="p432" class="sentence">12  In that day the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,Will call for weeping and mourning,For shaved heads and the wearing of sackcloth.</span>
<span id="p433" class="sentence">13  But instead, there is celebration and rejoicing,The killing of cattle and the slaughtering of sheep,The eating of meat and the drinking of wine.
‘Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.’”</span>
<span id="p434" class="sentence">14  Then Jehovah of armies revealed himself in my ears: “‘This error will not be atoned in your behalf until you people die,’ says the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.”</span>
<span id="p435" class="sentence">15  This is what the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, says: “Go in to this steward, to Shebʹna, who is in charge of the house, and say,</span>
<span id="p436" class="sentence">16  ‘What is your interest here, and who is there of interest to you here, that you hewed out a burial place here for yourself?’ He is hewing out his burial place in a high place; he is cutting out a resting-place for himself in a crag.</span>
<span id="p437" class="sentence">17  ‘Look! Jehovah will hurl you down violently, O man, and seize you forcibly.</span>
<span id="p438" class="sentence">18  He will certainly wrap you up tightly and hurl you like a ball into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will be, a disgrace to your master’s house.</span>
<span id="p439" class="sentence">19  And I will depose you from your position and throw you out of your office.</span>
<span id="p440" class="sentence">20  “‘In that day I will call my servant E·liʹa·kim the son of Hil·kiʹah,</span>
<span id="p441" class="sentence">21  and I will clothe him with your robe and firmly bind your sash around him, and I will give your authority into his hand. And he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</span>
<span id="p442" class="sentence">22  And I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder. He will open and no one will shut; and he will shut and no one will open.</span>
<span id="p443" class="sentence">23  I will drive him in as a peg in a lasting place, and he will become as a throne of glory to the house of his father.</span>
<span id="p444" class="sentence">24  And they will hang on him all the glory of the house of his father, the descendants and the offspring, all the small vessels, the bowl-shaped vessels, as well as all the large jars.</span>
<span id="p445" class="sentence">25  “‘In that day,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘the peg that is driven in a lasting place will be removed, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that it supported will fall to ruin, for Jehovah himself has spoken.’”</span></p></level1>
