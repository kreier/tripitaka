<level1><h1 id="p978">Chapter 46</h1>
<p><span id="p979" class="sentence">Bel bends down, Neʹbo stoops over.
Their idols are loaded on animals, on beasts of burden,Like baggage that burdens the weary animals.</span>
<span id="p980" class="sentence">2  They stoop and bend down together;They cannot rescue the loads,And they themselves go into captivity.</span>
<span id="p981" class="sentence">3  “Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all you who remain of the house of Israel,You whom I have supported from birth and carried from the womb.</span>
<span id="p982" class="sentence">4  Until you grow old I will be the same;Until your hair is gray I will keep bearing you.
As I have done, I will carry you and bear you and rescue you.</span>
<span id="p983" class="sentence">5  To whom will you liken me or make me equal or compare me,So that we should resemble each other?</span>
<span id="p984" class="sentence">6  There are those who lavish gold from their purse;They weigh out the silver on the scale.
They hire a metalworker, and he makes it into a god.
Then they prostrate themselves, yes, they worship it.</span>
<span id="p985" class="sentence">7  They lift it to their shoulders;They carry it and put it in its place, and it just stands there.
It does not move from its place.
They cry out to it, but it does not answer;It cannot rescue anyone from distress.</span>
<span id="p986" class="sentence">8  Remember this, and take courage.
Take it to heart, you transgressors.</span>
<span id="p987" class="sentence">9  Remember the former things of long ago,That I am God, and there is no other.
I am God, and there is no one like me.</span>
<span id="p988" class="sentence">10  From the beginning I foretell the outcome,And from long ago the things that have not yet been done.
I say, ‘My decision will stand,And I will do whatever I please.’</span>
<span id="p989" class="sentence">11  I am calling a bird of prey from the sunrise,From a distant land the man to carry out my decision.
I have spoken, and I will bring it about.
I have purposed it, and I will also carry it out.</span>
<span id="p990" class="sentence">12  Listen to me, you who are stubborn of heart,You who are far away from righteousness.</span>
<span id="p991" class="sentence">13  I have brought my righteousness near;It is not far away,And my salvation will not delay.
I will grant salvation in Zion, my splendor to Israel.”</span></p></level1>
