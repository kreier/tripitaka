<level1><h1 id="p658">Chapter 33</h1>
<p><span id="p659" class="sentence">Woe to you, you destroyer who has not been destroyed;You betrayer who has not been betrayed!
When you finish destroying, you will be destroyed.
When you finish betraying, you will be betrayed.</span>
<span id="p660" class="sentence">2  O Jehovah, show us favor.
Our hope is in you.
Become our arm every morning,Yes, our salvation in the time of distress.</span>
<span id="p661" class="sentence">3  At the sound of turmoil peoples flee.
When you rise up, nations scatter.</span>
<span id="p662" class="sentence">4  As the voracious locusts gather, so your spoil will be gathered;People will rush on it like swarms of locusts.</span>
<span id="p663" class="sentence">5  Jehovah will be exalted,For he resides in the heights above.
He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness.</span>
<span id="p664" class="sentence">6  He is the stability of your times;An abundance of salvation, wisdom, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah—This is his treasure.</span>
<span id="p665" class="sentence">7  Look! Their heroes cry out in the street;The messengers of peace weep bitterly.</span>
<span id="p666" class="sentence">8  The highways are deserted;There is no one traveling on the pathways.
He has broken the covenant;He has rejected the cities;He shows no regard for mortal man.</span>
<span id="p667" class="sentence">9  The land mourns and withers away.
Lebʹa·non is ashamed; it has decayed.
Sharʹon has become like the desert,And Baʹshan and Carʹmel shake off their leaves.</span>
<span id="p668" class="sentence">10  “Now I will rise up,” says Jehovah,“Now I will exalt myself;Now I will magnify myself.</span>
<span id="p669" class="sentence">11  You conceive dried grass and give birth to stubble.
Your own spirit will consume you like a fire.</span>
<span id="p670" class="sentence">12  And peoples will become as the burnings of lime.
As thorns cut down, they will be set ablaze with fire.</span>
<span id="p671" class="sentence">13  You who are far away, listen to what I will do!
And you who are nearby, acknowledge my might!</span>
<span id="p672" class="sentence">14  The sinners in Zion are in dread;Trembling has seized the apostates:
‘Who of us can live where there is a consuming fire?
Who of us can live with unquenchable flames?’</span>
<span id="p673" class="sentence">15  The one who walks in continual righteousness,Who speaks what is upright,Who rejects dishonest, fraudulent gain,Whose hands refuse a bribe rather than grabbing it,Who closes his ear to talk of bloodshed,And who shuts his eyes to avoid seeing what is bad</span>
<span id="p674" class="sentence">16  —He will reside in the heights;His secure refuge will be in rocky strongholds,His bread will be provided,And his water supply will never fail.”</span>
<span id="p675" class="sentence">17  Your eyes will behold a king in his splendor;They will see a land far away.</span>
<span id="p676" class="sentence">18  In your heart you will recall the terror:
“Where is the secretary?
Where is the one who weighed out the tribute?
Where is the one who counted the towers?”</span>
<span id="p677" class="sentence">19  You will no more see the insolent people,A people whose language is too obscure to comprehend,Whose stammering tongue you cannot understand.</span>
<span id="p678" class="sentence">20  Behold Zion, the city of our festivals!
Your eyes will see Jerusalem as a tranquil dwelling place,A tent that will not be moved.
Never will its tent pins be pulled out,And none of its ropes will be torn apart.</span>
<span id="p679" class="sentence">21  But there the Majestic One, Jehovah,Will be for us a region of rivers, of wide canals,Where no galley fleet will goAnd no majestic ships will pass by.</span>
<span id="p680" class="sentence">22  For Jehovah is our Judge,Jehovah is our Lawgiver,Jehovah is our King;He is the One who will save us.</span>
<span id="p681" class="sentence">23  Your ropes will hang loose;They cannot hold up the mast nor spread the sail.
At that time an abundance of spoil will be divided up;Even the lame will take much plunder.</span>
<span id="p682" class="sentence">24  And no resident will say: “I am sick.”
The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.</span></p></level1>
