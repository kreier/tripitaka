<p><span id="p1263" class="sentence">For the sake of Zion I will not keep silent,And for the sake of Jerusalem I will not keep stillUntil her righteousness shines like a bright lightAnd her salvation burns like a torch.</span>
<span id="p1264" class="sentence">2  “The nations will see your righteousness, O woman,And all kings your glory.
And you will be called by a new name,Which Jehovah’s own mouth will designate.</span>
<span id="p1265" class="sentence">3  You will become a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah,A royal turban in the palm of your God.</span>
<span id="p1266" class="sentence">4  No more will you be called an abandoned woman,And your land will no longer be called desolate.
But you will be called My Delight Is in Her,And your land will be called the Married One.
For Jehovah will take delight in you,And your land will be as one married.</span>
<span id="p1267" class="sentence">5  For just as a young man marries a virgin,Your sons will marry you.
With the rejoicing of a bridegroom over a bride,Your God will rejoice over you.</span>
<span id="p1268" class="sentence">6  Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have commissioned watchmen.
Continuously, all day long and all night long, they should not be silent.
You who make mention of Jehovah,Do not rest,</span>
<span id="p1269" class="sentence">7  And do not give him any rest until he firmly establishes Jerusalem,Yes, until he makes her the praise of the earth.”</span>
<span id="p1270" class="sentence">8  Jehovah has sworn an oath with his right hand, with his strong arm:
“I will no longer give your grain as food to your enemies,Nor will foreigners drink your new wine, for which you have toiled.</span>
<span id="p1271" class="sentence">9  But those gathering it will eat it and they will praise Jehovah;And those collecting it will drink it in my holy courtyards.”</span>
<span id="p1272" class="sentence">10  Pass through, pass through the gates.
Clear the way for the people.
Build up, build up the highway.
Rid it of stones.
Raise up a signal for the peoples.</span>
<span id="p1273" class="sentence">11  Look! Jehovah has proclaimed to the ends of the earth:
“Say to the daughter of Zion,‘Look! Your salvation is coming.
Look! His reward is with him,And the wage he pays is before him.’”</span>
<span id="p1274" class="sentence">12  They will be called the holy people, those repurchased by Jehovah,And you will be called Sought After, a City Not Abandoned.</span></p></level1>
