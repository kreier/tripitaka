<p><span id="p84" class="sentence">And seven women will grab hold of one man in that day, saying:
“We will eat our own breadAnd wear our own clothing;Only let us be called by your nameTo take away our disgrace.”</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">2  In that day what Jehovah makes sprout will be splendid and glorious, and the fruitage of the land will be the pride and beauty of the survivors of Israel.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">3  Whoever remains in Zion and is left over in Jerusalem will be called holy, all of those in Jerusalem written down for life.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">4  When Jehovah washes away the filth of the daughters of Zion and rinses away the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning,</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">5  Jehovah will also create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over the place of her conventions a cloud and smoke by day and a bright flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a shelter.</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">6  And there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain.</span></p></level1>
