<p><span id="p347" class="sentence">A pronouncement against Damascus:
“Look! Damascus will cease to be a city,And it will become a heap of ruins.</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">2  The cities of A·roʹer will be abandoned;They will become places for flocks to lie downWith no one to make them afraid.</span>
<span id="p349" class="sentence">3  Fortified cities will disappear from Eʹphra·im,And the kingdom from Damascus;And those remaining of SyriaWill be like the glory of the Israelites,” declares Jehovah of armies.</span>
<span id="p350" class="sentence">4  “In that day the glory of Jacob will diminish,And his healthy body will grow thin.</span>
<span id="p351" class="sentence">5  It will be as when the harvester is gathering the standing grainAnd his arm harvests the ears of grain,Like when one gleans grain in the Valley of Rephʹa·im.</span>
<span id="p352" class="sentence">6  Only gleanings will be left,As when an olive tree is beaten:
Only two or three ripe olives remain on the highest branch,Only four or five on its fruit-bearing branches,” declares Jehovah the God of Israel.</span>
<span id="p353" class="sentence">7  In that day man will look up to his Maker, and his eyes will gaze at the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span id="p354" class="sentence">8  He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands; and he will not gaze at what his fingers have made, either the sacred poles or the incense stands.</span>
<span id="p355" class="sentence">9  In that day his fortress cities will become like an abandoned site in the woodland,Like a branch that was abandoned before the Israelites;It will become a wasteland.</span>
<span id="p356" class="sentence">10  For you have forgotten the God of your salvation;You have failed to remember the Rock of your fortress.
That is why you plant beautiful plantationsAnd set it with the shoot of a stranger.</span>
<span id="p357" class="sentence">11  In the day you carefully fence in your plantation,In the morning you make your seed sprout,But the harvest will vanish in the day of disease and incurable pain.</span>
<span id="p358" class="sentence">12  Listen! There is a commotion of many peoples,Who are as boisterous as the seas!
There is an uproar of nations,Whose sound is like the roar of mighty waters!</span>
<span id="p359" class="sentence">13  The nations will make a sound like the roar of many waters.
He will rebuke them, and they will flee far away,Chased like the chaff of the mountains before a wind,Like a whirling thistle before a storm wind.</span>
<span id="p360" class="sentence">14  In the evening there is terror.
Before morning they are no more.
This is the share of those pillaging usAnd the lot of those plundering us.</span></p></level1>
