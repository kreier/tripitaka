<p><span id="p1156" class="sentence">This is what Jehovah says:
“Uphold justice, and do what is righteous,For my salvation will soon comeAnd my righteousness will be revealed.</span>
<span id="p1157" class="sentence">2  Happy is the man who does thisAnd the son of man who holds fast to it,Who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane itAnd who holds his hand back from any kind of evil.</span>
<span id="p1158" class="sentence">3  The foreigner who joins himself to Jehovah should not say,‘Jehovah will surely separate me from his people.’
And the eunuch should not say, ‘Look! I am a dried-up tree.’”</span>
<span id="p1159" class="sentence">4  For this is what Jehovah says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths and who choose what I delight in and who hold fast to my covenant:</span>
<span id="p1160" class="sentence">5  “I will give to them in my house and within my walls a monument and a name,Something better than sons and daughters.
An everlasting name I will give them,One that will not perish.</span>
<span id="p1161" class="sentence">6  As for the foreigners who join themselves to Jehovah to minister to him,To love the name of JehovahAnd to be his servants,All those who keep the Sabbath and do not profane itAnd who hold fast to my covenant,</span>
<span id="p1162" class="sentence">7  I will also bring them to my holy mountainAnd make them rejoice inside my house of prayer.
Their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar.
For my house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.”</span>
<span id="p1163" class="sentence">8  The Sovereign Lord Jehovah, who is gathering the dispersed ones of Israel, declares:
“I will gather to him others besides those already gathered.”</span>
<span id="p1164" class="sentence">9  All you wild animals of the field, come to eat,All you wild animals in the forest.</span>
<span id="p1165" class="sentence">10  His watchmen are blind, none of them have taken note.
All of them are speechless dogs, unable to bark.
They are panting and lying down; they love to slumber.</span>
<span id="p1166" class="sentence">11  They are dogs with a voracious appetite;They are never satisfied.
They are shepherds who have no understanding.
They have all gone their own way;Every last one of them seeks his own dishonest gain and says:</span>
<span id="p1167" class="sentence">12  “Come, let me take some wine,And let us drink our fill of alcohol.
And tomorrow will be like today, only far better!”</span></p></level1>
