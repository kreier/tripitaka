<level1><h1 id="p33">Chapter 2</h1>
<p><span id="p34" class="sentence">This is what Isaiah the son of Aʹmoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">2  In the final part of the days,The mountain of the house of JehovahWill become firmly established above the top of the mountains,And it will be raised up above the hills,And to it all the nations will stream.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">3  And many peoples will go and say:
“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah,To the house of the God of Jacob.
He will instruct us about his ways,And we will walk in his paths.”
For law will go out of Zion,And the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">4  He will render judgment among the nationsAnd set matters straight respecting many peoples.
They will beat their swords into plowsharesAnd their spears into pruning shears.
Nation will not lift up sword against nation,Nor will they learn war anymore.</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">5  O house of Jacob, come,Let us walk in the light of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">6  For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,Because they have become full of things from the East;They practice magic like the Phi·lisʹtines,And they abound with the children of foreigners.</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">7  Their land is filled with silver and gold,And there is no limit to their treasures.
Their land is filled with horses,And there is no limit to their chariots.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">8  Their land is filled with worthless gods.
They bow down to the work of their own hands,To what their own fingers have made.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">9  So man bows down, he becomes low,And you cannot possibly pardon them.</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">10  Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dustBecause of the terrifying presence of JehovahAnd his majestic splendor.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">11  The haughty eyes of man will be brought low,And the arrogance of men will bow down.
Jehovah alone will be exalted in that day.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">12  For it is the day belonging to Jehovah of armies.
It is coming upon everyone who is haughty and lofty,Upon everyone, whether exalted or lowly,</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">13  Upon all the cedars of Lebʹa·non that are lofty and exaltedAnd upon all the oaks of Baʹshan,</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">14  Upon all the lofty mountainsAnd upon all the high hills,</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">15  Upon every high tower and every fortified wall,</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">16  Upon all the ships of TarʹshishAnd upon all desirable boats.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">17  Man’s haughtiness will be brought down,And the arrogance of men will bow low.
Jehovah alone will be exalted in that day.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">18  The worthless gods will completely disappear.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">19  And people will enter into the caves of the rocksAnd into the holes in the ground,Because of the terrifying presence of JehovahAnd his majestic splendor,When he arises to make the earth tremble in terror.</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">20  In that day men will take their worthless gods of silver and of goldThat they had made for themselves to bow down toAnd throw them away to the shrewmice and to the bats,</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">21  In order to enter into the holes in the rocksAnd into the clefts of the crags,Because of the terrifying presence of JehovahAnd his majestic splendor,When he arises to make the earth tremble in terror.</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">22  For your own sakes, quit trusting in mere man,Who is only the breath in his nostrils.
Why should he be taken into account?</span></p></level1>
