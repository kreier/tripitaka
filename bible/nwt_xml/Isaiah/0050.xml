<p><span id="p1059" class="sentence">This is what Jehovah says:
“Where is the divorce certificate of your mother, whom I sent away?
Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?
Look! It was because of your own errors you were sold,And because of your own transgressions your mother was sent away.</span>
<span id="p1060" class="sentence">2  Why, then, was no one here when I came?
Why did no one answer when I called?
Is my hand too short to redeem,Or is there no power in me to rescue?
Look! With my rebuke I dry up the sea;I make rivers a desert.
Their fish rot for lack of water,And they die because of thirst.</span>
<span id="p1061" class="sentence">3  I clothe the heavens with gloom,And I make sackcloth their covering.”</span>
<span id="p1062" class="sentence">4  The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those taught,So that I may know how to answer the tired one with the right word.
He awakens me morning by morning;He awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.</span>
<span id="p1063" class="sentence">5  The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear,And I was not rebellious.
I did not turn in the opposite direction.</span>
<span id="p1064" class="sentence">6  I offered my back to those striking meAnd my cheeks to those who plucked them bare.
I did not hide my face from humiliating things and from spit.</span>
<span id="p1065" class="sentence">7  But the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will help me.
That is why I will not feel humiliated.
That is why I have set my face like a flint,And I know that I will not be put to shame.</span>
<span id="p1066" class="sentence">8  The One who declares me righteous is near.
Who can accuse me?
Let us stand up together.
Who has a case against me?
Let him approach me.</span>
<span id="p1067" class="sentence">9  Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will help me.
Who will pronounce me guilty?
Look! They will all wear out like a garment.
A moth will eat them up.</span>
<span id="p1068" class="sentence">10  Who among you fears JehovahAnd listens to the voice of his servant?
Who has walked in deep darkness, without any brightness?
Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and support himself on his God.</span>
<span id="p1069" class="sentence">11  “Look! All of you who are igniting a fire,Making sparks fly,Walk in the light of your fire,Among the sparks you have set ablaze.
This is what you will have from my hand:
In sheer pain you will lie down.</span></p></level1>
