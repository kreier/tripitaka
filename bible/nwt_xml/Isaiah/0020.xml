<p><span id="p396" class="sentence">In the year that King Sarʹgon of As·syrʹi·a sent the Tarʹtan to Ashʹdod, he fought against Ashʹdod and captured it.</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">2  At that time Jehovah spoke through Isaiah the son of Aʹmoz, saying: “Go, remove the sackcloth from your hips, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, walking about naked and barefoot.</span>
<span id="p398" class="sentence">3  Jehovah then said: “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked about naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and E·thi·oʹpi·a,</span>
<span id="p399" class="sentence">4  so the king of As·syrʹi·a will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of E·thi·oʹpi·a, boys and old men, naked and barefoot and with exposed buttocks, the nakedness of Egypt.</span>
<span id="p400" class="sentence">5  And they will be terrified and will be ashamed of E·thi·oʹpi·a their hope and of Egypt their pride.</span>
<span id="p401" class="sentence">6  The inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, ‘Look at what happened to our hope, to which we fled for help and rescue from the king of As·syrʹi·a! How will we escape now?’”</span></p></level1>
