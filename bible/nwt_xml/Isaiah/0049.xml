<level1><h1 id="p1031">Chapter 49</h1>
<p><span id="p1032" class="sentence">Listen to me, you islands,And pay attention, you faraway nations.
Jehovah has called me before I was born.
From the time I was in my mother’s womb he has made mention of my name.</span>
<span id="p1033" class="sentence">2  He made my mouth like a sharp sword;He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.
He made me a polished arrow;He concealed me in his quiver.</span>
<span id="p1034" class="sentence">3  He said to me: “You are my servant, O Israel,Through whom I will show my splendor.”</span>
<span id="p1035" class="sentence">4  But I said: “I have toiled for nothing.
I used up my strength for an unreality, in vain.
But surely my judgment is with Jehovah,And my wages with my God.”</span>
<span id="p1036" class="sentence">5  And now Jehovah, the One who formed me from the womb as his servant,Has said for me to bring Jacob back to him,So that Israel may be gathered to him.
I will be glorified in the eyes of Jehovah,And my God will have become my strength.</span>
<span id="p1037" class="sentence">6  And he said: “It is not enough that you are my servantTo raise up the tribes of JacobAnd to bring back those who were preserved of Israel.
I have also given you as a light of nations,So that my salvation may reach the ends of the earth.”</span>
<span id="p1038" class="sentence">7  This is what Jehovah, the Repurchaser of Israel, his Holy One, says to the one who is despised, to the one who is detested by the nation, to the servant of rulers:
“Kings will see and rise up,And princes will bow downBecause of Jehovah, who is faithful,The Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</span>
<span id="p1039" class="sentence">8  This is what Jehovah says:
“In a time of favor I answered you,And in a day of salvation I helped you;I kept safeguarding you to give you as a covenant for the people,To rehabilitate the land,To cause them to possess their desolate inheritances,</span>
<span id="p1040" class="sentence">9  To say to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’
And to those in the darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’
By the roadways they will feed,Along all the worn paths will be their pastures.</span>
<span id="p1041" class="sentence">10  They will not go hungry, nor will they thirst,Nor will scorching heat or the sun beat down on them.
For the One who has mercy on them will lead them,And he will guide them by the springs of water.</span>
<span id="p1042" class="sentence">11  I will make all my mountains into a road,And my highways will be raised up.</span>
<span id="p1043" class="sentence">12  Look! These are coming from far away,And look! these from the north and from the west,And these from the land of Siʹnim.”</span>
<span id="p1044" class="sentence">13  Shout for joy, you heavens, and rejoice, you earth.
Let the mountains become cheerful with a joyful cry.
For Jehovah has comforted his people,And he shows mercy to his own afflicted ones.</span>
<span id="p1045" class="sentence">14  But Zion kept saying:
“Jehovah has abandoned me, and Jehovah has forgotten me.”</span>
<span id="p1046" class="sentence">15  Can a woman forget her nursing childOr have no compassion for the son of her womb?
Even if these women forget, I would never forget you.</span>
<span id="p1047" class="sentence">16  Look! On my palms I have engraved you.
Your walls are always before me.</span>
<span id="p1048" class="sentence">17  Your sons hurry back.
Those who tore you down and devastated you will depart from you.</span>
<span id="p1049" class="sentence">18  Raise your eyes and look all around.
They are all gathering together.
They are coming to you.
“As surely as I am living,” declares Jehovah,“You will clothe yourself with all of them as with ornaments,And you will fasten them on yourself as a bride does.</span>
<span id="p1050" class="sentence">19  Although your places were devastated and desolate and your land was in ruins,Now it will become too cramped for those dwelling there,And those who swallowed you down will be far away.</span>
<span id="p1051" class="sentence">20  The sons born when you were bereaved will say in your hearing,‘This place is too cramped for me.
Make room for me to dwell here.’</span>
<span id="p1052" class="sentence">21  And you will say in your heart,‘Who has fathered these for me,Since I am a woman bereaved of children and barren,Exiled and taken prisoner?
Who has raised these?
Look! I was left all alone,So where have these come from?’”</span>
<span id="p1053" class="sentence">22  This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“Look! I will raise up my hand to the nations,And I will lift up my signal to the peoples.
They will bring your sons in their armsAnd carry your daughters on their shoulders.</span>
<span id="p1054" class="sentence">23  Kings will become caretakers for you,And their princesses will be your nurses.
They will bow down to you with their faces to the groundAnd lick the dust of your feet,And you will have to know that I am Jehovah;Those hoping in me will not be put to shame.”</span>
<span id="p1055" class="sentence">24  Can those already captured be taken from a mighty man,Or can the captives of the tyrant be rescued?</span>
<span id="p1056" class="sentence">25  But this is what Jehovah says:
“Even the captives of a mighty man will be taken away,And those captured by the tyrant will be rescued.
I will oppose those who oppose you,And I will save your own sons.</span>
<span id="p1057" class="sentence">26  I will make those who mistreat you eat their own flesh,And as with sweet wine, they will become drunk with their own blood.
And all people will have to know that I am Jehovah,Your Savior and your Repurchaser,The Powerful One of Jacob.”</span></p></level1>
