<level1><h1 id="p135">Chapter 7</h1>
<p><span id="p136" class="sentence">Now in the days of Aʹhaz son of Joʹtham son of Uz·ziʹah, the king of Judah, King Reʹzin of Syria and Peʹkah son of Rem·a·liʹah, the king of Israel, came up to wage war against Jerusalem, but he could not capture it.</span>
<span id="p137" class="sentence">2  A report was made to the house of David: “Syria has joined forces with Eʹphra·im.”
And the heart of Aʹhaz and the heart of his people began to tremble, like the trees of the forest shaking in the wind.</span>
<span id="p138" class="sentence">3  Jehovah then said to Isaiah: “Go out, please, to meet Aʹhaz, you and your son Sheʹar-jaʹshub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool by the highway of the laundryman’s field.</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">4  You must say to him, ‘Take care to stay calm. Do not be afraid, and do not lose heart because of these two stumps of smoldering logs, because of the hot anger of Reʹzin and Syria and the son of Rem·a·liʹah.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">5  For Syria with Eʹphra·im and the son of Rem·a·liʹah have plotted harm against you, saying:</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">6  “Let us go up against Judah and tear it apart and conquer it for ourselves, and let us appoint the son of Tabʹe·el as its king.”</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">7  “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“It will not succeed,Nor will it take place.</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">8  For the head of Syria is Damascus,And the head of Damascus is Reʹzin.
Within just 65 yearsEʹphra·im will be completely shattered and cease to be a people.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">9  The head of Eʹphra·im is Sa·marʹi·a,And the head of Sa·marʹi·a is the son of Rem·a·liʹah.
Unless you have firm faith,You will not be firmly established.”’”</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">10  Jehovah continued speaking to Aʹhaz:</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">11  “Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; it may be as deep as the Grave or as high as the sky.”</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">12  But Aʹhaz said: “I will not ask, nor will I put Jehovah to the test.”</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">13  Isaiah then said: “Listen, please, O house of David. Is it not enough that you try the patience of men? Must you also try the patience of God?</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">14  Therefore, Jehovah himself will give you a sign: Look! The young woman will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and she will name him Im·manʹu·el.</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">15  He will eat butter and honey by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good.</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">16  For before the boy knows how to reject the bad and choose the good, the land of the two kings whom you dread will be completely abandoned.</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">17  Jehovah will bring against you and against your people and against the house of your father a time such as has not come since the day Eʹphra·im broke away from Judah, for He will bring the king of As·syrʹi·a.</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">18  “In that day Jehovah will whistle for the flies from the distant streams of the Nile of Egypt and for the bees in the land of As·syrʹi·a,</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">19  and they will all come and settle down on the steep valleys, on the rocky clefts, on all the thornbushes, and on all the watering places.</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">20  “In that day by means of a hired razor from the region of the River, by means of the king of As·syrʹi·a, Jehovah will shave the head and the hair of the legs, and it will sweep away the beard as well.</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">21  “In that day a man will keep alive a young cow of the herd and two sheep.</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">22  And because of the abundance of milk, he will eat butter, for everyone remaining in the land will eat butter and honey.</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">23  “In that day wherever there used to be 1,000 vines worth 1,000 pieces of silver, there will be only thornbushes and weeds.</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">24  Men will go there with bow and arrow, because all the land will become thornbushes and weeds.</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">25  And all the mountains that used to be cleared with a hoe, you will not go near for fear of thornbushes and weeds; they will become a grazing place for bulls and a trampling ground of sheep.”</span></p></level1>
