<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">The older man to Gaʹius, the beloved, whom I truly love.</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  Beloved one, I pray that in all things you continue to prosper and enjoy good health, just as you are now prospering.</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  For I rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness about the truth you hold, as you go on walking in the truth.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  No greater joy do I have than this: that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  Beloved one, you show your faithfulness in what you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  They have given a witness about your love before the congregation. Please send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  For it was in behalf of his name that they went out, not taking anything from the people of the nations.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  So we are under obligation to show hospitality to such ones, so that we may become fellow workers in the truth.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  I wrote something to the congregation, but Di·otʹre·phes, who likes to have the first place among them, does not accept anything from us with respect.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  That is why if I come, I will call attention to the works he is doing in spreading malicious talk about us. Not being content with this, he refuses to welcome the brothers with respect; and those who want to welcome them, he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good. The one who does good originates with God. The one who does bad has not seen God.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  De·meʹtri·us has been well-reported-on by them all and by the truth itself. In fact, we too are bearing witness about him, and you know that the witness we give is true.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  I had many things to write you, but I do not wish to go on writing you with pen and ink.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  However, I am hoping to see you soon, and we will speak face-to-face.
May you have peace.
The friends send you their greetings. Give my greetings to the friends by name.</span></p></level1>
