<p><span id="p1247" class="sentence">And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span>
<span id="p1248" class="sentence">2  “Give these instructions to the Israelites: ‘When you go into the land of Caʹnaan, this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance, the land of Caʹnaan according to its boundaries.</span>
<span id="p1249" class="sentence">3  “‘Your southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin alongside Eʹdom, and your south boundary on the east will be from the extremity of the Salt Sea.</span>
<span id="p1250" class="sentence">4  Your boundary will change direction to pass south of the ascent of A·krabʹbim and continue to Zin, and its end will be south of Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a. Then it will extend to Haʹzar-adʹdar and continue to Azʹmon.</span>
<span id="p1251" class="sentence">5  The boundary will change direction at Azʹmon to the Wadi of Egypt, and its end will be at the Sea.</span>
<span id="p1252" class="sentence">6  “‘Your western boundary will be the Great Sea and the coast. This will become your western boundary.</span>
<span id="p1253" class="sentence">7  “‘Now this will be your northern boundary: From the Great Sea you will mark your boundary out to Mount Hor.</span>
<span id="p1254" class="sentence">8  From Mount Hor you will mark out the boundary to Leʹbo-haʹmath, and the end of the boundary will be at Zeʹdad.</span>
<span id="p1255" class="sentence">9  And the boundary will extend to Ziphʹron, and its end will be Haʹzar-eʹnan. This will become your northern boundary.</span>
<span id="p1256" class="sentence">10  “‘Then you should mark as your boundary on the east from Haʹzar-eʹnan to Sheʹpham.</span>
<span id="p1257" class="sentence">11  The boundary will extend from Sheʹpham to Ribʹlah on the east of Aʹin, and the border will go down and cross the eastern slope of the Sea of Chinʹne·reth.</span>
<span id="p1258" class="sentence">12  The border will extend to the Jordan, and its end will be the Salt Sea. This will be your land and the boundaries surrounding it.’”</span>
<span id="p1259" class="sentence">13  So Moses instructed the Israelites, saying: “This is the land that you will apportion as your possession by lot, just as Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes.</span>
<span id="p1260" class="sentence">14  For the tribe of the Reuʹben·ites by their paternal house, the tribe of the Gadʹites by their paternal house, and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh have already taken their inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1261" class="sentence">15  The two and a half tribes have already taken their inheritance east of the region of the Jordan by Jerʹi·cho, toward the sunrising.”</span>
<span id="p1262" class="sentence">16  Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:</span>
<span id="p1263" class="sentence">17  “These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you to possess: El·e·aʹzar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.</span>
<span id="p1264" class="sentence">18  And you will take one chieftain out of each tribe to divide the land as your inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1265" class="sentence">19  These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh;</span>
<span id="p1266" class="sentence">20  of the tribe of the sons of Simʹe·on, She·muʹel the son of Am·miʹhud;</span>
<span id="p1267" class="sentence">21  of the tribe of Benjamin, E·liʹdad the son of Chisʹlon;</span>
<span id="p1268" class="sentence">22  of the tribe of the sons of Dan, a chieftain, Bukʹki the son of Jogʹli;</span>
<span id="p1269" class="sentence">23  of the sons of Joseph from the tribe of the sons of Ma·nasʹseh, a chieftain, Hanʹni·el the son of Eʹphod;</span>
<span id="p1270" class="sentence">24  from the tribe of the sons of Eʹphra·im, a chieftain, Kem·uʹel the son of Shiphʹtan;</span>
<span id="p1271" class="sentence">25  of the tribe of the sons of Zebʹu·lun, a chieftain, E·li·zaʹphan the son of Parʹnach;</span>
<span id="p1272" class="sentence">26  of the tribe of the sons of Isʹsa·char, a chieftain, Palʹti·el the son of Azʹzan;</span>
<span id="p1273" class="sentence">27  of the tribe of the sons of Ashʹer, a chieftain, A·hiʹhud the son of She·loʹmi;</span>
<span id="p1274" class="sentence">28  of the tribe of the sons of Naphʹta·li, a chieftain, Ped·ahʹel the son of Am·miʹhud.”</span>
<span id="p1275" class="sentence">29  These are the ones whom Jehovah commanded to distribute the land to the Israelites in the land of Caʹnaan.</span></p></level1>
