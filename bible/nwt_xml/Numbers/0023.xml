<level1><h1 id="p835">Chapter 23</h1>
<p><span id="p836" class="sentence">Then Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Build on this spot seven altars, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”</span>
<span id="p837" class="sentence">2  Baʹlak immediately did just as Baʹlaam had said. And Baʹlak and Baʹlaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</span>
<span id="p838" class="sentence">3  Baʹlaam then said to Baʹlak: “Stay here by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Jehovah will get in touch with me. Whatever he reveals to me, I will tell you.” So he went to a barren hill.</span>
<span id="p839" class="sentence">4  Then God got in touch with Baʹlaam, who said to Him: “I set the seven altars in rows, and I offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.”</span>
<span id="p840" class="sentence">5  Jehovah put this word in the mouth of Baʹlaam: “Return to Baʹlak, and this is what you are to say.”</span>
<span id="p841" class="sentence">6  So he returned and saw that Baʹlak and all the princes of Moʹab were standing by his burnt offering.</span>
<span id="p842" class="sentence">7  Then he spoke this proverbial saying:
“Baʹlak the king of Moʹab has brought me from Aʹram,From the mountains of the east:
‘Do come to curse Jacob for me.
Yes, come to denounce Israel.’</span>
<span id="p843" class="sentence">8  How could I put a curse on those whom God has not cursed?
And how could I denounce those whom Jehovah has not denounced?</span>
<span id="p844" class="sentence">9  From the top of the rocks I see them,And from the hills I see them.
As a people they dwell there alone;They do not count themselves among the nations.</span>
<span id="p845" class="sentence">10  Who can number the dust particles of JacobOr count even the fourth part of Israel?
Let me die the death of the upright,And let my end be like theirs.”</span>
<span id="p846" class="sentence">11  Baʹlak then said to Baʹlaam: “What have you done to me? I brought you to put a curse on my enemies, and here you have done nothing but bless them.”</span>
<span id="p847" class="sentence">12  He answered: “Must I not speak whatever Jehovah puts in my mouth?”</span>
<span id="p848" class="sentence">13  Baʹlak said to him: “Please come with me to another place from which you can see them. You will see only a part of them; you will not see them all. Put a curse on them for me from there.”</span>
<span id="p849" class="sentence">14  So he took him to the field of Zoʹphim, to the top of Pisʹgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</span>
<span id="p850" class="sentence">15  So Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Stay here by your burnt offering while I get in touch with Him over there.”</span>
<span id="p851" class="sentence">16  And Jehovah got in touch with Baʹlaam and put this word in his mouth: “Return to Baʹlak, and this is what you are to say.”</span>
<span id="p852" class="sentence">17  So he came to him and saw that he was waiting by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moʹab were with him. Baʹlak asked him: “What has Jehovah said?”</span>
<span id="p853" class="sentence">18  Then he spoke this proverbial saying:
“Get up, Baʹlak, and listen.
Hear me, O son of Zipʹpor.</span>
<span id="p854" class="sentence">19  God is not a mere man who tells lies,Nor a son of man who changes his mind.
When he says something, will he not do it?
When he speaks, will he not carry it out?</span>
<span id="p855" class="sentence">20  Look! I have been taken to bless;Now He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.</span>
<span id="p856" class="sentence">21  He does not tolerate any magical power against Jacob,And he does not allow any trouble against Israel.
Jehovah his God is with them,And he is loudly hailed as king among them.</span>
<span id="p857" class="sentence">22  God is bringing them out of Egypt.
He is like the horns of a wild bull for them.</span>
<span id="p858" class="sentence">23  For there are no omens of doom against Jacob,Nor any divination against Israel.
At this time it may be said about Jacob and Israel:
‘Look at what God has done!’</span>
<span id="p859" class="sentence">24  Here is a people who will rise up like a lion,And like the lion, it will raise itself up.
It will not lie down until it eats preyAnd drinks the blood of the slain ones.”</span>
<span id="p860" class="sentence">25  Baʹlak then said to Baʹlaam: “If on the one hand you cannot put any curse on him, then on the other hand you should not bless him either.”</span>
<span id="p861" class="sentence">26  Baʹlaam answered Baʹlak: “Did I not say to you, ‘I will do all that Jehovah says’?”</span>
<span id="p862" class="sentence">27  Baʹlak said to Baʹlaam: “Please come and let me take you to yet another place. Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of the true God for you to put a curse on him for me from there.”</span>
<span id="p863" class="sentence">28  So Baʹlak took Baʹlaam to the top of Peʹor, which looks toward Je·shiʹmon.</span>
<span id="p864" class="sentence">29  Then Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Build seven altars on this spot, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”</span>
<span id="p865" class="sentence">30  So Baʹlak did just as Baʹlaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</span></p></level1>
