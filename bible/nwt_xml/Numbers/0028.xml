<span id="p1003" class="sentence">2  “Command the Israelites and tell them, ‘You should take care that you present to me my offering, my bread. My offerings by fire as a pleasing aroma to me must be made at their appointed times.’</span>
<span id="p1004" class="sentence">3  “And say to them, ‘This is the offering made by fire that you will present to Jehovah: two sound year-old male lambs a day as a burnt offering regularly.</span>
<span id="p1005" class="sentence">4  The one male lamb you will offer in the morning, and the other male lamb you will offer at twilight,</span>
<span id="p1006" class="sentence">5  together with a tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil as a grain offering.</span>
<span id="p1007" class="sentence">6  It is a regular burnt offering, which was established at Mount Siʹnai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to Jehovah,</span>
<span id="p1008" class="sentence">7  along with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin for each male lamb. Pour out the alcoholic drink in the holy place as a drink offering to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1009" class="sentence">8  And you will offer the other male lamb at twilight. With the same grain offering as that made in the morning and with its same drink offering, you will present it as an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1010" class="sentence">9  “‘However, on the Sabbath day, the offering should be two sound year-old male lambs and two tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, together with its drink offering.</span>
<span id="p1011" class="sentence">10  This is the burnt offering for the Sabbath, along with the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.</span>
<span id="p1012" class="sentence">11  “‘At the start of each month you will present as a burnt offering to Jehovah two young bulls, one ram, and seven sound male lambs each a year old,</span>

<span id="p1014" class="sentence">13  and a tenth measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each male lamb, as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1015" class="sentence">14  And their drink offerings should be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a male lamb. This is the monthly burnt offering each month throughout the year.</span>
