<level1><h1 id="p331">Chapter 12</h1>
<p><span id="p332" class="sentence">The one who loves discipline loves knowledge,But the one who hates reproof is unreasoning.</span>
<span id="p333" class="sentence">2  The good person obtains Jehovah’s approval,But He condemns the man of wicked schemes.</span>
<span id="p334" class="sentence">3  No man is made secure by wickedness,But the righteous will never be uprooted.</span>
<span id="p335" class="sentence">4  A capable wife is a crown to her husband,But the wife who acts shamefully is like rottenness in his bones.</span>
<span id="p336" class="sentence">5  The thoughts of the righteous are just,But the guidance of the wicked is deceptive.</span>
<span id="p337" class="sentence">6  The words of the wicked are a deadly ambush,But the mouth of the upright saves them.</span>
<span id="p338" class="sentence">7  When the wicked are overthrown, they are no more,But the house of the righteous will keep standing.</span>
<span id="p339" class="sentence">8  A man is praised for the discretion of his mouth,But one with a twisted heart will be treated with contempt.</span>
<span id="p340" class="sentence">9  Better to be lightly esteemed and have a servantThan to glorify oneself and have no food.</span>
<span id="p341" class="sentence">10  The righteous one takes care of his domestic animals,But even the mercy of the wicked is cruel.</span>
<span id="p342" class="sentence">11  The one who cultivates his land will be satisfied with food,But the one pursuing worthless things is lacking good sense.</span>
<span id="p343" class="sentence">12  The wicked man envies what other evil men have caught,But the root of the righteous bears fruit.</span>
<span id="p344" class="sentence">13  The evil man is ensnared by his own sinful speech,But the righteous one escapes from distress.</span>
<span id="p345" class="sentence">14  From the fruitage of his speech a man is satisfied with good,And the work of his hands will reward him.</span>
<span id="p346" class="sentence">15  The way of the fool is right in his own eyes,But the wise one accepts advice.</span>
<span id="p347" class="sentence">16  A fool immediately shows his annoyance,But the shrewd man overlooks an insult.</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">17  The one who testifies faithfully will tell the truth,But a false witness speaks deceit.</span>
<span id="p349" class="sentence">18  Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword,But the tongue of the wise is a healing.</span>
<span id="p350" class="sentence">19  Truthful lips will endure forever,But a lying tongue will last for only a moment.</span>
<span id="p351" class="sentence">20  Deceit is in the heart of those who plot mischief,But those who promote peace have joy.</span>
<span id="p352" class="sentence">21  No harm will befall the righteous one,But the wicked will have their fill of calamity.</span>
<span id="p353" class="sentence">22  Lying lips are detestable to Jehovah,But those acting faithfully bring pleasure to him.</span>
<span id="p354" class="sentence">23  A shrewd man conceals what he knows,But the heart of the fool blurts out his foolishness.</span>
<span id="p355" class="sentence">24  The hand of the diligent ones will rule,But idle hands will be put to forced labor.</span>
<span id="p356" class="sentence">25  Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,But a good word cheers it up.</span>
<span id="p357" class="sentence">26  The righteous one searches out his pastures,But the course of the wicked leads them astray.</span>
<span id="p358" class="sentence">27  The lazy do not chase after the prey,But diligence is a man’s precious treasure.</span>
<span id="p359" class="sentence">28  The path of righteousness leads to life;Along its pathway there is no death.</span></p></level1>
