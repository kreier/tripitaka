<level1><h1 id="p519">Chapter 18</h1>
<p><span id="p520" class="sentence">Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires;He rejects all practical wisdom.</span>
<span id="p521" class="sentence">2  A stupid person takes no pleasure in understanding;He would rather disclose what is in his heart.</span>
<span id="p522" class="sentence">3  When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes,And along with dishonor there is disgrace.</span>
<span id="p523" class="sentence">4  The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters.
The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.</span>
<span id="p524" class="sentence">5  It is not good to show partiality to the wicked oneOr to deprive the righteous one of justice.</span>
<span id="p525" class="sentence">6  The speech of the stupid one leads to quarrels,And his mouth invites a beating.</span>
<span id="p526" class="sentence">7  The mouth of the stupid is his ruin,And his lips are a snare for his life.</span>
<span id="p527" class="sentence">8  The words of a slanderer are like tasty morsels;They are gulped right down into the stomach.</span>
<span id="p528" class="sentence">9  Whoever is lazy in his workIs a brother to the one who causes ruin.</span>
<span id="p529" class="sentence">10  The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.
Into it the righteous one runs and receives protection.</span>
<span id="p530" class="sentence">11  The wealth of the rich is his fortified city;It is like a protective wall in his imagination.</span>
<span id="p531" class="sentence">12  Before a crash a man’s heart is lofty,And before glory there is humility.</span>
<span id="p532" class="sentence">13  When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts,It is foolish and humiliating.</span>
<span id="p533" class="sentence">14  A person’s spirit can sustain him through illness,But who can bear a crushed spirit?</span>
<span id="p534" class="sentence">15  The heart of the understanding one acquires knowledge,And the ear of the wise seeks to find knowledge.</span>
<span id="p535" class="sentence">16  A man’s gift opens the way for him;It gives him access to great people.</span>
<span id="p536" class="sentence">17  The first to state his case seems right,Until the other party comes and cross-examines him.</span>
<span id="p537" class="sentence">18  Casting lots puts an end to disputesAnd decides between strong opponents.</span>
<span id="p538" class="sentence">19  A brother offended is more unyielding than a fortified city,And there are disputes like the bars of a fortress.</span>
<span id="p539" class="sentence">20  From the fruitage of a man’s speech his stomach will be filled;He will be satisfied with what his lips produce.</span>
<span id="p540" class="sentence">21  Death and life are in the power of the tongue;Those who love to use it will eat its fruitage.</span>
<span id="p541" class="sentence">22  The one who finds a good wife has found something good,And he receives Jehovah’s favor.</span>
<span id="p542" class="sentence">23  The poor man implores when speaking,But the rich man answers harshly.</span>
<span id="p543" class="sentence">24  There are companions ready to crush one another,But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</span></p></level1>
