<level1><h1 id="p386">Chapter 14</h1>
<p><span id="p387" class="sentence">The truly wise woman builds up her house,But the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.</span>
<span id="p388" class="sentence">2  The one walking in his uprightness fears Jehovah,But the one whose ways are devious despises Him.</span>
<span id="p389" class="sentence">3  The rod of haughtiness is in the mouth of the fool,But the lips of the wise will protect them.</span>
<span id="p390" class="sentence">4  Where there are no cattle the manger is clean,But the power of a bull yields an abundant harvest.</span>
<span id="p391" class="sentence">5  A faithful witness will not lie,But a false witness lies with every breath.</span>
<span id="p392" class="sentence">6  The scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none,But knowledge comes easily to the person with understanding.</span>
<span id="p393" class="sentence">7  Stay away from the foolish man,For you will not find knowledge on his lips.</span>
<span id="p394" class="sentence">8  By wisdom the shrewd man understands the way he is going,But the stupid are deceived by their foolishness.</span>
<span id="p395" class="sentence">9  Fools make fun of guilt,But among the upright, there is a willingness to reconcile.</span>
<span id="p396" class="sentence">10  The heart knows its own bitterness,And no outsider can share in its joy.</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">11  The house of the wicked will be destroyed,But the tent of the upright will flourish.</span>
<span id="p398" class="sentence">12  There is a way that seems right to a man,But in the end it leads to death.</span>
<span id="p399" class="sentence">13  Even in laughter the heart may feel pain,And rejoicing may end in grief.</span>
<span id="p400" class="sentence">14  The one wayward at heart will reap the results of his ways,But the good man reaps the reward of his dealings.</span>
<span id="p401" class="sentence">15  The naive person believes every word,But the shrewd one ponders each step.</span>
<span id="p402" class="sentence">16  The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil,But the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.</span>
<span id="p403" class="sentence">17  The one who is quick to anger acts foolishly,But the man who thinks things out is hated.</span>
<span id="p404" class="sentence">18  The naive will inherit foolishness,But the shrewd are crowned with knowledge.</span>
<span id="p405" class="sentence">19  Bad people will have to bow down before the good,And the wicked will bow at the gates of the righteous.</span>
<span id="p406" class="sentence">20  The poor man is hated even by his neighbors,But many are the friends of the rich person.</span>
<span id="p407" class="sentence">21  The one who despises his neighbor sins,But whoever shows compassion to the lowly is happy.</span>
<span id="p408" class="sentence">22  Will not those who plot mischief go astray?
But those intent on doing good will receive loyal love and faithfulness.</span>
<span id="p409" class="sentence">23  There is benefit in every kind of hard work,But mere talk leads to want.</span>
<span id="p410" class="sentence">24  The crown of the wise is their wealth;But the foolishness of the stupid is only foolishness.</span>
<span id="p411" class="sentence">25  A true witness saves lives,But a deceitful one lies with every breath.</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">26  There is strong confidence in the fear of Jehovah,And it will be a refuge for his children.</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">27  The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life,To turn one away from the snares of death.</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">28  A multitude of people are a king’s majesty,But a ruler without subjects is ruined.</span>
<span id="p415" class="sentence">29  The one who is slow to anger has great discernment,But the impatient one displays his foolishness.</span>
<span id="p416" class="sentence">30  A calm heart gives life to the body,But jealousy is rottenness to the bones.</span>
<span id="p417" class="sentence">31  The one who defrauds the lowly one insults his Maker,But whoever shows compassion to the poor glorifies Him.</span>
<span id="p418" class="sentence">32  The wicked one will be brought down by his own evil,But the righteous one will find refuge in his integrity.</span>
<span id="p419" class="sentence">33  Wisdom rests quietly in the heart of an understanding person,But among the stupid it must make itself known.</span>
<span id="p420" class="sentence">34  Righteousness exalts a nation,But sin is disgraceful to a people.</span>
<span id="p421" class="sentence">35  The king finds pleasure in a servant who acts with insight,But his fury is against the one who acts shamefully.</span></p></level1>
