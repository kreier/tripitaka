<p><span id="p638" class="sentence">A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth;To be respected is better than silver and gold.</span>
<span id="p639" class="sentence">2  The rich and the poor have this in common:
Jehovah made them both.</span>
<span id="p640" class="sentence">3  The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,But the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.</span>
<span id="p641" class="sentence">4  The result of humility and the fear of JehovahIs riches and glory and life.</span>
<span id="p642" class="sentence">5  Thorns and traps are in the crooked man’s path,But whoever values his life keeps far away from them.</span>
<span id="p643" class="sentence">6  Train a boy in the way he should go;Even when he grows old he will not depart from it.</span>
<span id="p644" class="sentence">7  The rich one rules the poor,And the borrower is a slave to the lender.</span>
<span id="p645" class="sentence">8  Whoever sows unrighteousness will reap disaster,And the rod of his fury will come to its end.</span>
<span id="p646" class="sentence">9  The generous person will be blessed,For he shares his food with the poor.</span>
<span id="p647" class="sentence">10  Drive away the scornful man,And contention will disappear;Disputes and insults will cease.</span>
<span id="p648" class="sentence">11  The one who loves a pure heart and whose speech is graciousWill have the king as his friend.</span>
<span id="p649" class="sentence">12  The eyes of Jehovah safeguard knowledge,But He overturns the words of the treacherous.</span>
<span id="p650" class="sentence">13  The lazy one says: “There is a lion outside!
I will be killed in the middle of the public square!”</span>
<span id="p651" class="sentence">14  The mouth of wayward women is a deep pit.
The one condemned by Jehovah will fall into it.</span>
<span id="p652" class="sentence">15  Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a boy,But the rod of discipline will remove it far from him.</span>
<span id="p653" class="sentence">16  The one defrauding the poor to increase his wealthAnd the one giving gifts to the richWill end up in poverty.</span>
<span id="p654" class="sentence">17  Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise,In order to apply your heart to my knowledge,</span>
<span id="p655" class="sentence">18  For it is pleasant to keep them deep within you,So that all of them may constantly be on your lips.</span>
<span id="p656" class="sentence">19  For your confidence to be in Jehovah,I am giving you knowledge today.</span>
<span id="p657" class="sentence">20  Have I not already written you,Imparting advice and knowledge,</span>
<span id="p658" class="sentence">21  To teach you true and reliable words,So that you can return with an accurate report to the one who sent you?</span>
<span id="p659" class="sentence">22  Do not rob the poor man because he is poor,And do not crush the lowly man in the city gate,</span>
<span id="p660" class="sentence">23  For Jehovah himself will plead their causeAnd he will take the life of those who defraud them.</span>
<span id="p661" class="sentence">24  Do not keep company with a hot-tempered manOr get involved with one disposed to rage,</span>
<span id="p662" class="sentence">25  So that you never learn his waysAnd ensnare yourself.</span>
<span id="p663" class="sentence">26  Do not be among those who shake hands in a pledge,Who put up security for loans.</span>
<span id="p664" class="sentence">27  If you have nothing to pay,Your bed will be taken right out from under you!</span>
<span id="p665" class="sentence">28  Do not move an ancient boundary markerThat your forefathers put in place.</span>
<span id="p666" class="sentence">29  Have you seen a man skillful at his work?
He will stand before kings;He will not stand before common men.</span></p></level1>
