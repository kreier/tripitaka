<level1><h1 id="p767">Chapter 26</h1>
<p><span id="p768" class="sentence">Like snow in summer and rain at harvesttime,Honor is not fitting for someone stupid.</span>
<span id="p769" class="sentence">2  Just as a bird has reason to flee and a swallow to fly,So a curse does not come without a real reason.</span>
<span id="p770" class="sentence">3  A whip is for the horse, a bridle is for the donkey,And the rod is for the back of stupid people.</span>
<span id="p771" class="sentence">4  Do not answer the stupid one according to his foolishness,So that you do not put yourself on his level.</span>
<span id="p772" class="sentence">5  Answer the stupid one according to his foolishness,So that he does not think he is wise.</span>
<span id="p773" class="sentence">6  Like someone who cripples his own feet and harms himselfIs the one who entrusts matters to someone stupid.</span>
<span id="p774" class="sentence">7  Like the limp legs of the lame,So is a proverb in the mouth of stupid people.</span>
<span id="p775" class="sentence">8  Like tying a stone to a sling,So is giving glory to someone stupid.</span>
<span id="p776" class="sentence">9  Like a thorn plant that comes into the hand of a drunkard,So is a proverb in the mouth of stupid people.</span>
<span id="p777" class="sentence">10  Like an archer who wounds at random,So is the one who hires the stupid one or those passing by.</span>
<span id="p778" class="sentence">11  Like a dog that returns to its vomit,The stupid one repeats his foolishness.</span>
<span id="p779" class="sentence">12  Have you seen a man who thinks he is wise?
There is more hope for someone stupid than for him.</span>
<span id="p780" class="sentence">13  The lazy one says: “There is a young lion in the road,A lion in the public square!”</span>
<span id="p781" class="sentence">14  A door keeps turning on its hinges,And the lazy one on his bed.</span>
<span id="p782" class="sentence">15  The lazy one buries his hand in the banquet bowl,But he is too tired to bring it back to his mouth.</span>
<span id="p783" class="sentence">16  The lazy one thinks he is wiserThan seven people who give a sensible reply.</span>
<span id="p784" class="sentence">17  Like someone grabbing hold of a dog’s earsIs the one passing by who becomes furious about a quarrel that is not his.</span>
<span id="p785" class="sentence">18  Like a madman who shoots fiery missiles, arrows, and death</span>
<span id="p786" class="sentence">19  Is the man who plays a trick on his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”</span>
<span id="p787" class="sentence">20  Where there is no wood, the fire goes out,And where there is no slanderer, quarreling ceases.</span>
<span id="p788" class="sentence">21  As charcoal for the embers and wood for the fire,So a contentious man kindles a quarrel.</span>
<span id="p789" class="sentence">22  The words of a slanderer are like tasty morsels;They are gulped right down into the stomach.</span>
<span id="p790" class="sentence">23  Like a silver glazing over a piece of earthenwareAre affectionate words from an evil heart.</span>
<span id="p791" class="sentence">24  The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,But inside he harbors deceit.</span>
<span id="p792" class="sentence">25  Although he speaks graciously, do not trust him,For there are seven detestable things in his heart.</span>
<span id="p793" class="sentence">26  Though his hatred is concealed by deceit,His evil will be exposed in the congregation.</span>
<span id="p794" class="sentence">27  The one who digs a pit will fall into it,And whoever rolls away a stone—it will come back on him.</span>
<span id="p795" class="sentence">28  A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,And a flattering mouth causes ruin.</span></p></level1>
