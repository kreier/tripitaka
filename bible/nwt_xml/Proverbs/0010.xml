<p><span id="p267" class="sentence">Proverbs of Solʹo·mon.
A wise son makes his father rejoice,But a foolish son is the grief of his mother.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">2  The treasures gained by wickedness will be of no benefit,But righteousness is what rescues from death.</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">3  Jehovah will not cause the righteous one to go hungry,But he will deny the wicked what they crave.</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">4  Idle hands will cause poverty,But diligent hands bring riches.</span>
<span id="p271" class="sentence">5  The son acting with insight gathers the crop in summer,But the son acting shamefully is fast asleep during the harvest.</span>
<span id="p272" class="sentence">6  Blessings are on the head of the righteous one,But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.</span>
<span id="p273" class="sentence">7  The memory of the righteous one is due for a blessing,But the name of the wicked will rot.</span>
<span id="p274" class="sentence">8  The wisehearted person will accept instructions,But the one speaking foolishly will be trodden down.</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">9  The one walking in integrity will walk in security,But the one making his ways crooked will be found out.</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">10  The one who slyly winks his eye causes grief,And the one who speaks foolishly will be trodden down.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">11  The mouth of the righteous one is a source of life,But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.</span>
<span id="p278" class="sentence">12  Hatred is what stirs up contentions,But love covers over all transgressions.</span>
<span id="p279" class="sentence">13  Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning person,But the rod is for the back of one lacking good sense.</span>
<span id="p280" class="sentence">14  Those who are wise treasure up knowledge,But the mouth of the fool invites ruin.</span>
<span id="p281" class="sentence">15  The wealth of a rich man is his fortified city.
The ruin of the poor is their poverty.</span>
<span id="p282" class="sentence">16  The activity of the righteous one leads to life;But the produce of the wicked one leads to sin.</span>
<span id="p283" class="sentence">17  The one who heeds discipline is a path to life,But the one who ignores reproof leads others astray.</span>
<span id="p284" class="sentence">18  The one who conceals his hatred speaks lies,And the one spreading malicious reports is stupid.</span>
<span id="p285" class="sentence">19  When words are many, transgression cannot be avoided,But whoever controls his lips acts discreetly.</span>
<span id="p286" class="sentence">20  The tongue of the righteous one is like the finest silver,But the heart of the wicked one is worth little.</span>
<span id="p287" class="sentence">21  The lips of the righteous one nourish many,But the foolish die for lack of sense.</span>
<span id="p288" class="sentence">22  It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich,And He adds no pain with it.</span>
<span id="p289" class="sentence">23  Engaging in shameful conduct is like a game to the stupid one,But wisdom is for the man of discernment.</span>
<span id="p290" class="sentence">24  What the wicked one fears will come upon him;But the desire of the righteous will be granted.</span>
<span id="p291" class="sentence">25  When the storm passes by, the wicked one will be no more,But the righteous one is a foundation forever.</span>
<span id="p292" class="sentence">26  Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,So the lazy person is to the one who sends him.</span>
<span id="p293" class="sentence">27  The fear of Jehovah prolongs life,But the years of the wicked will be cut short.</span>
<span id="p294" class="sentence">28  The expectation of the righteous brings joy,But the hope of the wicked will perish.</span>
<span id="p295" class="sentence">29  The way of Jehovah is a stronghold for the blameless one,But it means ruin for evildoers.</span>
<span id="p296" class="sentence">30  The righteous one will never be made to fall,But the wicked will no longer inhabit the earth.</span>
<span id="p297" class="sentence">31  The mouth of the righteous one produces wisdom,But the perverse tongue will be cut off.</span>
<span id="p298" class="sentence">32  The lips of the righteous one know what is pleasing,But the mouth of the wicked is perverse.</span></p></level1>
