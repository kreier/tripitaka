<p><span id="p211" class="sentence">Is not wisdom calling out?
Is not discernment raising its voice?</span>
<span id="p212" class="sentence">2  On the heights along the road,It takes its position at the crossroads.</span>
<span id="p213" class="sentence">3  Next to the gates leading into the city,At the entrances of the doorways,It keeps crying out loudly:</span>
<span id="p214" class="sentence">4  “To you, O people, I am calling;I raise my voice to everyone.</span>
<span id="p215" class="sentence">5  You inexperienced ones, learn shrewdness;You stupid ones, acquire an understanding heart.</span>
<span id="p216" class="sentence">6  Listen, for what I say is important,My lips speak what is right;</span>
<span id="p217" class="sentence">7  For my mouth softly utters truth,And my lips detest what is wicked.</span>
<span id="p218" class="sentence">8  All the sayings of my mouth are righteous.
None of them are twisted or crooked.</span>
<span id="p219" class="sentence">9  They are all straightforward to the discerningAnd right to those who have found knowledge.</span>
<span id="p220" class="sentence">10  Take my discipline instead of silver,And knowledge rather than the finest gold,</span>
<span id="p221" class="sentence">11  For wisdom is better than corals;All other desirable things cannot compare to it.</span>
<span id="p222" class="sentence">12  I, wisdom, dwell together with shrewdness;I have found knowledge and thinking ability.</span>
<span id="p223" class="sentence">13  The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.
I hate self-exaltation and pride and the evil way and perverse speech.</span>
<span id="p224" class="sentence">14  I possess good advice and practical wisdom;Understanding and power are mine.</span>
<span id="p225" class="sentence">15  By me kings keep reigning,And high officials decree righteousness.</span>
<span id="p226" class="sentence">16  By me princes keep ruling,And nobles judge in righteousness.</span>
<span id="p227" class="sentence">17  I love those loving me,And those seeking me will find me.</span>
<span id="p228" class="sentence">18  Riches and glory are with me,Lasting wealth and righteousness.</span>
<span id="p229" class="sentence">19  My fruitage is better than gold, even refined gold,And what I produce is better than the finest silver.</span>
<span id="p230" class="sentence">20  I walk in the path of righteousness,In the middle of the pathways of justice;</span>
<span id="p231" class="sentence">21  I give a rich inheritance to those who love me,And I fill up their storehouses.</span>
<span id="p232" class="sentence">22  Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way,The earliest of his achievements of long ago.</span>
<span id="p233" class="sentence">23  From ancient times I was installed,From the start, from times earlier than the earth.</span>
<span id="p234" class="sentence">24  When there were no deep waters, I was brought forth,When there were no springs overflowing with water.</span>
<span id="p235" class="sentence">25  Before the mountains were set in place,Before the hills, I was brought forth,</span>
<span id="p236" class="sentence">26  When he had not yet made the earth and its fieldsOr the first clods of earth’s soil.</span>
<span id="p237" class="sentence">27  When he prepared the heavens, I was there;When he marked out the horizon on the surface of the waters,</span>
<span id="p238" class="sentence">28  When he established the clouds above,When he founded the fountains of the deep,</span>
<span id="p239" class="sentence">29  When he set a decree for the seaThat its waters should not pass beyond his order,When he established the foundations of the earth,</span>
<span id="p240" class="sentence">30  Then I was beside him as a master worker.
I was the one he was especially fond of day by day;I rejoiced before him all the time;</span>
<span id="p241" class="sentence">31  I rejoiced over his habitable earth,And I was especially fond of the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p242" class="sentence">32  And now, my sons, listen to me;Yes, happy are those who keep my ways.</span>
<span id="p243" class="sentence">33  Listen to discipline and become wise,And never neglect it.</span>
<span id="p244" class="sentence">34  Happy is the man who listens to meBy coming early to my doors day by day,By waiting next to my doorposts;</span>
<span id="p245" class="sentence">35  For the one finding me will find life,And he receives approval from Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p246" class="sentence">36  But the one who ignores me harms himself,And those who hate me love death.”</span></p></level1>
