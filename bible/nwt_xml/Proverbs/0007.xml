<level1><h1 id="p182">Chapter 7</h1>
<p><span id="p183" class="sentence">My son, keep my sayings,And treasure up my commandments.</span>
<span id="p184" class="sentence">2  Keep my commandments and live;Guard my instruction like the pupil of your eye.</span>
<span id="p185" class="sentence">3  Tie them around your fingers;Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span>
<span id="p186" class="sentence">4  Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
And call understanding “my relative,”</span>
<span id="p187" class="sentence">5  To guard you against the wayward woman,Against the immoral woman and her smooth words.</span>
<span id="p188" class="sentence">6  From the window of my house,Through my lattice, I looked down,</span>
<span id="p189" class="sentence">7  And as I observed the naive ones,I discerned among the youths a young man lacking good sense.</span>
<span id="p190" class="sentence">8  He passed along the street near her corner,And he marched in the direction of her house</span>
<span id="p191" class="sentence">9  In the twilight, in the evening,At the approach of night and darkness.</span>
<span id="p192" class="sentence">10  Then I saw a woman meet him,Dressed like a prostitute, with a cunning heart.</span>
<span id="p193" class="sentence">11  She is loud and defiant.
She never stays at home.</span>
<span id="p194" class="sentence">12  One moment she is outside, next she is in the public squares,She lurks near every corner.</span>
<span id="p195" class="sentence">13  She grabs hold of him and gives him a kiss;With a bold face, she says to him:</span>
<span id="p196" class="sentence">14  “I had to offer communion sacrifices.
Today I paid my vows.</span>
<span id="p197" class="sentence">15  That is why I came out to meet you,To look for you, and I found you!</span>
<span id="p198" class="sentence">16  I have spread fine covers upon my bed,Colorful linen from Egypt.</span>
<span id="p199" class="sentence">17  I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span>
<span id="p200" class="sentence">18  Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning;Let us enjoy passionate love together,</span>
<span id="p201" class="sentence">19  For my husband is not at home;He has gone on a distant journey.</span>
<span id="p202" class="sentence">20  He took a bag of money with him,And he will not return until the day of the full moon.”</span>
<span id="p203" class="sentence">21  She misleads him with great persuasiveness.
She seduces him with smooth speech.</span>
<span id="p204" class="sentence">22  Suddenly he goes after her, like a bull to the slaughter,Like a fool to be punished in the stocks,</span>
<span id="p205" class="sentence">23  Until an arrow pierces his liver;Like a bird rushing into a trap, he does not know that it will cost him his life.</span>
<span id="p206" class="sentence">24  And now, my sons, listen to me;Pay attention to the words I speak.</span>
<span id="p207" class="sentence">25  Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways.
Do not stray onto her paths,</span>
<span id="p208" class="sentence">26  For she has caused many to fall down slain,And those she has killed are numerous.</span>
<span id="p209" class="sentence">27  Her house leads to the Grave;It goes down to the inner chambers of death.</span></p></level1>
