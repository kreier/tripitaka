<level1><h1 id="p544">Chapter 19</h1>
<p><span id="p545" class="sentence">It is better to be poor and walk in integrityThan to be stupid and speak lies.</span>
<span id="p546" class="sentence">2  A person without knowledge is not good,And the one who acts rashly is sinning.</span>
<span id="p547" class="sentence">3  It is a man’s own foolishness that distorts his way,And his heart becomes enraged against Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p548" class="sentence">4  Wealth attracts many friends,But the poor man will be deserted even by his friend.</span>
<span id="p549" class="sentence">5  A false witness will not go unpunished,And the one who lies with every breath will not escape.</span>
<span id="p550" class="sentence">6  Many seek the favor of a noble,And everyone is a friend to the man who gives gifts.</span>
<span id="p551" class="sentence">7  All the brothers of a poor man hate him;How much more he is shunned by his friends!
He pursues them with requests, but no one responds.</span>
<span id="p552" class="sentence">8  Whoever acquires good sense loves himself.
Whoever treasures discernment will find success.</span>
<span id="p553" class="sentence">9  A false witness will not go unpunished,And the one who lies with every breath will perish.</span>
<span id="p554" class="sentence">10  It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury;How much less for a servant to rule over princes!</span>
<span id="p555" class="sentence">11  The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger,And it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.</span>
<span id="p556" class="sentence">12  The king’s rage is like the growling of a lion,But his favor is like dew on the vegetation.</span>
<span id="p557" class="sentence">13  A stupid son brings adversity on his father,And a quarrelsome wife is like a roof that never stops leaking.</span>
<span id="p558" class="sentence">14  A house and wealth are inherited from fathers,But a discreet wife is from Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p559" class="sentence">15  Laziness brings on a deep sleep,And a sluggish person will go hungry.</span>
<span id="p560" class="sentence">16  The one who keeps the commandment keeps his life;The one who is reckless about his ways will die.</span>
<span id="p561" class="sentence">17  The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah,And He will repay him for what he does.</span>
<span id="p562" class="sentence">18  Discipline your son while there is hope,And do not become responsible for his death.</span>
<span id="p563" class="sentence">19  The hot-tempered man will pay the penalty;If you try to spare him, you will have to do it again and again.</span>
<span id="p564" class="sentence">20  Listen to counsel and accept discipline,In order to become wise in your future.</span>
<span id="p565" class="sentence">21  Many are the plans in a man’s heart,But the counsel of Jehovah is what will prevail.</span>
<span id="p566" class="sentence">22  The desirable thing in a man is his loyal love;And it is better to be poor than to be a liar.</span>
<span id="p567" class="sentence">23  The fear of Jehovah leads to life;The one who has it will have a pleasant rest, free from harm.</span>
<span id="p568" class="sentence">24  The lazy one buries his hand in the banquet bowl,But he does not even bother to bring it back to his mouth.</span>
<span id="p569" class="sentence">25  Strike the ridiculer, so that the inexperienced one may become shrewd,And reprove the understanding one, so that he will increase in knowledge.</span>
<span id="p570" class="sentence">26  The one who mistreats his father and drives away his motherIs a son causing shame and disgrace.</span>
<span id="p571" class="sentence">27  My son, if you stop listening to discipline,You will stray from the sayings of knowledge.</span>
<span id="p572" class="sentence">28  A worthless witness mocks justice,And the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.</span>
<span id="p573" class="sentence">29  Judgment is in store for ridiculers,And beatings for the back of the stupid ones.</span></p></level1>
