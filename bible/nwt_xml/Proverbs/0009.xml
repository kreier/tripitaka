<p><span id="p248" class="sentence">True wisdom has built its house;It has carved out its seven pillars.</span>
<span id="p249" class="sentence">2  It has fully prepared its meat;It has mixed its wine;It has also arranged its table.</span>
<span id="p250" class="sentence">3  It has sent out its female servantsTo call out from the heights above the city:</span>
<span id="p251" class="sentence">4  “Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.”
She says to the one lacking good sense:</span>
<span id="p252" class="sentence">5  “Come, eat my breadAnd share in drinking the wine that I have mixed.</span>
<span id="p253" class="sentence">6  Leave behind your inexperience and live;Walk forward in the way of understanding.”</span>
<span id="p254" class="sentence">7  The one who corrects a ridiculer invites dishonor,And whoever reproves someone wicked will get hurt.</span>
<span id="p255" class="sentence">8  Do not reprove a ridiculer, or he will hate you.
Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.</span>
<span id="p256" class="sentence">9  Share with a wise person, and he will become wiser.
Teach someone righteous, and he will add to his learning.</span>
<span id="p257" class="sentence">10  The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom,And knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.</span>
<span id="p258" class="sentence">11  For by me your days will be many,And years will be added to your life.</span>
<span id="p259" class="sentence">12  If you become wise, you are wise to your own advantage,But if you are a ridiculer, you alone will bear it.</span>
<span id="p260" class="sentence">13  A stupid woman is loud.
She is ignorant and knows absolutely nothing.</span>
<span id="p261" class="sentence">14  She sits at the entrance of her houseOn a seat in the high places of the city,</span>
<span id="p262" class="sentence">15  Calling out to those passing by,To those walking straight ahead on their way:</span>
<span id="p263" class="sentence">16  “Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.”
She says to those lacking good sense:</span>
<span id="p264" class="sentence">17  “Stolen waters are sweet,And food eaten in secret is pleasant.”</span>
<span id="p265" class="sentence">18  But he does not know that those powerless in death are there,That her guests are in the depths of the Grave.</span></p></level1>
