<level1><h1 id="p881">Chapter 30</h1>
<p><span id="p882" class="sentence">The weighty message contained in the words of Aʹgur son of Jaʹkeh, which he spoke to Ithʹi·el, to Ithʹi·el and Uʹcal.</span>
<span id="p883" class="sentence">2  I am more ignorant than anyone else,And I lack the understanding a man should have.</span>
<span id="p884" class="sentence">3  I have not learned wisdom,And I do not possess the knowledge of the Most Holy One.</span>
<span id="p885" class="sentence">4  Who has ascended to heaven and then descended?
Who has gathered the wind in the palms of both hands?
Who has wrapped up the waters in his garment?
Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is his name and the name of his son—if you know?</span>
<span id="p886" class="sentence">5  Every saying of God is refined.
He is a shield to those taking refuge in him.</span>
<span id="p887" class="sentence">6  Add nothing to his words,Or he will reprove you,And you will be proved a liar.</span>
<span id="p888" class="sentence">7  Two things I ask of you.
Do not withhold them from me before I die.</span>
<span id="p889" class="sentence">8  Remove untruth and lies far from me.
Give me neither poverty nor riches.
Just let me consume my portion of food,</span>
<span id="p890" class="sentence">9  So that I do not become satisfied and deny you and say, “Who is Jehovah?”
Nor let me become poor and steal and dishonor the name of my God.</span>
<span id="p891" class="sentence">10  Do not slander a servant to his master,Or he may curse you and you will be found guilty.</span>
<span id="p892" class="sentence">11  There is a generation that curses its fatherAnd does not bless its mother.</span>
<span id="p893" class="sentence">12  There is a generation that is pure in its own eyesBut has not been cleansed from its filth.</span>
<span id="p894" class="sentence">13  There is a generation whose eyes are so haughtyAnd whose eyes look so arrogantly!</span>
<span id="p895" class="sentence">14  There is a generation whose teeth are swordsAnd whose jaws are slaughtering knives;They devour the lowly ones of the earthAnd the poor from among mankind.</span>
<span id="p896" class="sentence">15  The leeches have two daughters that cry, “Give! Give!”
There are three things that do not get satisfied,Four that never say, “Enough!”</span>
<span id="p897" class="sentence">16  —The Grave and a barren womb,A land that is deprived of water,And fire that never says, “Enough!”</span>
<span id="p898" class="sentence">17  The eye that mocks a father and despises obedience to a mother—The ravens of the valley will peck it out,And the young eagles will eat it up.</span>
<span id="p899" class="sentence">18  There are three things that are beyond my comprehension,And four that I do not understand:</span>
<span id="p900" class="sentence">19  The way of an eagle in the heavens,The way of a serpent on a rock,The way of a ship in the open sea,And the way of a man with a young woman.</span>
<span id="p901" class="sentence">20  This is the way of an adulterous woman:
She eats, she wipes her mouth;Then she says, “I have done nothing wrong.”</span>
<span id="p902" class="sentence">21  There are three things that make the earth shudderAnd four things it cannot endure:</span>
<span id="p903" class="sentence">22  When a slave rules as king,When a fool is glutted with food,</span>
<span id="p904" class="sentence">23  When a hated woman is taken as a wife,And when a servant girl takes the place of her mistress.</span>
<span id="p905" class="sentence">24  Four things on earth are among the smallest,But they are instinctively wise:</span>
<span id="p906" class="sentence">25  The ants are not strong creatures,Yet they prepare their food in the summer.</span>
<span id="p907" class="sentence">26  The rock badgers are not mighty creatures,Yet they make their house in the crags.</span>
<span id="p908" class="sentence">27  The locusts have no king,Yet they all go forward in formation.</span>
<span id="p909" class="sentence">28  The gecko lizard clings with its feet,And it goes into the palace of a king.</span>
<span id="p910" class="sentence">29  There are three things that have an impressive stride,Four that are impressive as they move:</span>
<span id="p911" class="sentence">30  The lion, the mightiest among beasts,Which does not retreat from anyone;</span>
<span id="p912" class="sentence">31  The greyhound; the male goat;And a king whose army is with him.</span>
<span id="p913" class="sentence">32  If you have foolishly exalted yourselfOr if you have schemed to do so,Put your hand over your mouth.</span>
<span id="p914" class="sentence">33  For as the churning of milk produces butterAnd the squeezing of the nose produces blood,So the stirring up of anger produces quarrels.</span></p></level1>
