<p><span id="p95" class="sentence">Listen, my sons, to the discipline of a father;Pay attention in order to gain understanding,</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">2  For I will give you good instruction;Do not forsake my teaching.</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">3  I was a true son to my fatherAnd the one especially loved by my mother.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">4  He taught me and said: “May your heart hold fast to my words.
Keep my commandments and continue living.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">5  Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding.
Do not forget, and do not turn aside from what I say.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">6  Do not forsake it, and it will protect you.
Love it, and it will safeguard you.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">7  Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom,And with all you acquire, acquire understanding.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">8  Highly esteem it, and it will exalt you.
It will honor you because you embrace it.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">9  It will place an attractive wreath on your head;It will adorn you with a crown of beauty.”</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">10  Listen, my son, and accept my sayings,And the years of your life will be many.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">11  I will instruct you in the way of wisdom;I will lead you in the tracks of uprightness.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">12  When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;And if you run, you will not stumble.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">13  Hold on to discipline; do not let it go.
Safeguard it, for it means your life.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">14  Do not enter the path of the wicked,And do not walk in the way of evil men.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">15  Shun it, do not take it;Turn away from it, and pass it by.</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">16  For they cannot sleep unless they do what is bad.
They are robbed of sleep unless they cause someone’s downfall.</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">17  They feed themselves with the bread of wickedness,And they drink the wine of violence.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">18  But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning lightThat grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">19  The way of the wicked is like the darkness;They do not know what makes them stumble.</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">20  My son, pay attention to my words;Listen carefully to my sayings.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">21  Do not lose sight of them;Keep them deep within your heart,</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">22  For they are life to those who find themAnd health to their whole body.</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">23  Above all the things that you guard, safeguard your heart,For out of it are the sources of life.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">24  Put crooked speech away from you,And keep devious talk far away from you.</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">25  Your eyes should look straight ahead,Yes, fix your gaze straight ahead of you.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">26  Smooth out the course of your feet,And all your ways will be sure.</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">27  Do not incline to the right or the left.
Turn your feet away from what is bad.</span></p></level1>
