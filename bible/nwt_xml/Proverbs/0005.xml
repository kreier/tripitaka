<level1><h1 id="p122">Chapter 5</h1>
<p><span id="p123" class="sentence">My son, pay attention to my wisdom.
Listen carefully to my discernment,</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">2  So that you may guard your thinking abilitiesAnd safeguard knowledge with your lips.</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">3  For the lips of a wayward woman drip like a honeycomb,And her mouth is smoother than oil.</span>
<span id="p126" class="sentence">4  But in the end she is as bitter as wormwoodAnd as sharp as a two-edged sword.</span>
<span id="p127" class="sentence">5  Her feet descend into death.
Her steps lead straight to the Grave.</span>
<span id="p128" class="sentence">6  She gives no thought to the path of life.
Her course wanders, but she does not know where.</span>
<span id="p129" class="sentence">7  Now, my sons, listen to meAnd do not turn away from what I am saying.</span>
<span id="p130" class="sentence">8  Stay far away from her;Do not go near the entrance of her house,</span>
<span id="p131" class="sentence">9  So that you may not give your dignity to othersNor reap years of what is cruel;</span>
<span id="p132" class="sentence">10  So that strangers may not drain your resourcesAnd what you labored for go to the house of a foreigner.</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">11  Otherwise, you will groan at the end of your lifeWhen your flesh and body waste away</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">12  And you say: “How I hated discipline!
How my heart despised reproof!</span>
<span id="p135" class="sentence">13  I did not listen to the voice of my instructorsOr pay attention to my teachers.</span>
<span id="p136" class="sentence">14  I have come to the brink of complete ruinIn the midst of the entire congregation.”</span>
<span id="p137" class="sentence">15  Drink water from your own cisternAnd flowing water from your own well.</span>
<span id="p138" class="sentence">16  Should your springs be dispersed outside,Your streams of water in the public squares?</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">17  Let them be for you alone,And not for strangers with you.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">18  May your own fountain be blessed,And may you rejoice with the wife of your youth,</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">19  A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat.
Let her breasts satisfy you at all times.
May you be captivated by her love constantly.</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">20  So why, my son, should you be captivated by a wayward womanOr embrace the bosom of an immoral woman?</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">21  For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah;He examines all his paths.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">22  The wicked one is ensnared by his own errors,And he will be caught in the ropes of his own sin.</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">23  He will die for lack of disciplineAnd go astray because of his excessive foolishness.</span></p></level1>
