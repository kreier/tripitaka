<level1><h1 id="p360">Chapter 13</h1>
<p><span id="p361" class="sentence">A wise son accepts his father’s discipline,But the scoffer does not listen to a rebuke.</span>
<span id="p362" class="sentence">2  From the fruitage of his speech a man will eat what is good,But the very desire of the treacherous is for violence.</span>
<span id="p363" class="sentence">3  The one guarding his mouth protects his life,But the one opening his lips wide will come to ruin.</span>
<span id="p364" class="sentence">4  The lazy person has his cravings, yet he has nothing,But the diligent one will be fully satisfied.</span>
<span id="p365" class="sentence">5  The righteous one hates lies,But the actions of the wicked bring shame and disgrace.</span>
<span id="p366" class="sentence">6  Righteousness protects the one whose way is innocent,But wickedness brings down the sinner.</span>
<span id="p367" class="sentence">7  There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;There is another who pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.</span>
<span id="p368" class="sentence">8  Riches are the ransom for a man’s life,But the poor are not even threatened.</span>
<span id="p369" class="sentence">9  The light of the righteous shines brightly,But the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.</span>
<span id="p370" class="sentence">10  Presumptuousness leads only to strife,But wisdom belongs to those who seek advice.</span>
<span id="p371" class="sentence">11  Wealth quickly gained will dwindle,But the wealth of the one who gathers it little by little will increase.</span>
<span id="p372" class="sentence">12  Expectation postponed makes the heart sick,But a desire realized is a tree of life.</span>
<span id="p373" class="sentence">13  Whoever despises instruction will pay the penalty,But the one who respects the commandment will be rewarded.</span>
<span id="p374" class="sentence">14  The teaching of the wise one is a source of lifeTo turn one away from the snares of death.</span>
<span id="p375" class="sentence">15  Keen insight wins favor,But the way of the treacherous is harsh.</span>
<span id="p376" class="sentence">16  The shrewd person acts with knowledge,But the fool exposes his own foolishness.</span>
<span id="p377" class="sentence">17  A wicked messenger falls into trouble,But a faithful envoy brings healing.</span>
<span id="p378" class="sentence">18  Whoever neglects discipline comes to poverty and disgrace,But the one accepting correction will be glorified.</span>
<span id="p379" class="sentence">19  Desire when realized is sweet to a person,But the stupid hate to turn away from bad.</span>
<span id="p380" class="sentence">20  The one walking with the wise will become wise,But the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.</span>
<span id="p381" class="sentence">21  Calamity pursues sinners,But prosperity rewards the righteous.</span>
<span id="p382" class="sentence">22  The good person leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren,But the sinner’s wealth will be stored up for the righteous one.</span>
<span id="p383" class="sentence">23  The plowed field of the poor yields much food,But it may be swept away by injustice.</span>
<span id="p384" class="sentence">24  Whoever holds back his rod hates his son,But the one who loves him disciplines him diligently.</span>
<span id="p385" class="sentence">25  The righteous one eats and satisfies his appetite,But the stomach of the wicked is empty.</span></p></level1>
