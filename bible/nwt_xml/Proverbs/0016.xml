<level1><h1 id="p456">Chapter 16</h1>
<p><span id="p457" class="sentence">A man prepares the thoughts of his heart,But the answer he gives is from Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p458" class="sentence">2  All of a man’s ways seem right to him,But Jehovah examines the motives.</span>
<span id="p459" class="sentence">3  Commit to Jehovah whatever you do,And your plans will succeed.</span>
<span id="p460" class="sentence">4  Jehovah has made everything work for his purpose,Even the wicked for the day of disaster.</span>
<span id="p461" class="sentence">5  Everyone proud in heart is detestable to Jehovah.
Be assured that he will not go unpunished.</span>
<span id="p462" class="sentence">6  By loyal love and faithfulness, error is atoned for,And by fearing Jehovah one turns away from bad.</span>
<span id="p463" class="sentence">7  When Jehovah is pleased with a man’s ways,He causes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span>
<span id="p464" class="sentence">8  Better is a little with righteousnessThan a large income without justice.</span>
<span id="p465" class="sentence">9  A man may plot out his course in his heart,But it is Jehovah who directs his steps.</span>
<span id="p466" class="sentence">10  Inspired decision should be on the lips of a king;He must never betray justice.</span>
<span id="p467" class="sentence">11  Honest balances and scales are from Jehovah;All the weights in the bag are his doing.</span>
<span id="p468" class="sentence">12  Wicked practices are detestable to kings,For the throne is firmly established by righteousness.</span>
<span id="p469" class="sentence">13  Righteous speech is a pleasure to kings.
They love someone who speaks honestly.</span>
<span id="p470" class="sentence">14  The king’s rage is like a messenger of death,But the wise man appeases it.</span>
<span id="p471" class="sentence">15  In the light of the king’s face there is life;His favor is like a cloud of rain in spring.</span>
<span id="p472" class="sentence">16  How much better to acquire wisdom than gold!
To gain understanding is to be chosen over silver.</span>
<span id="p473" class="sentence">17  The highway of the upright avoids what is bad.
Whoever safeguards his way preserves his life.</span>
<span id="p474" class="sentence">18  Pride is before a crash,And a haughty spirit before stumbling.</span>
<span id="p475" class="sentence">19  Better to be humble among the meekThan to share the spoil of the haughty.</span>
<span id="p476" class="sentence">20  The one who shows insight in a matter will find success,And happy is the one trusting in Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p477" class="sentence">21  The wise in heart will be called understanding,And the one kind in speech adds persuasiveness.</span>
<span id="p478" class="sentence">22  Insight is a fountain of life to those possessing it,But fools are disciplined by their own foolishness.</span>
<span id="p479" class="sentence">23  The heart of the wise one gives his mouth insightAnd adds persuasiveness to his speech.</span>
<span id="p480" class="sentence">24  Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb,Sweet to the soul and a healing to the bones.</span>
<span id="p481" class="sentence">25  There is a way that seems right to a man,But in the end it leads to death.</span>
<span id="p482" class="sentence">26  The appetite of a laborer makes him work hardFor his hunger urges him on.</span>
<span id="p483" class="sentence">27  A worthless man digs up what is bad;His speech is like a scorching fire.</span>
<span id="p484" class="sentence">28  A troublemaker causes dissension,And a slanderer separates close friends.</span>
<span id="p485" class="sentence">29  A violent man entices his neighborAnd leads him in the wrong way.</span>
<span id="p486" class="sentence">30  He winks his eye as he schemes harm.
He pinches his lips together as he carries out mischief.</span>
<span id="p487" class="sentence">31  Gray hair is a crown of beautyWhen it is found in the way of righteousness.</span>
<span id="p488" class="sentence">32  The one slow to anger is better than a mighty man,And the one controlling his temper than one conquering a city.</span>
<span id="p489" class="sentence">33  The lot is cast into the lap,But every decision by it is from Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
