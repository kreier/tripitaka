<level1><h1 id="p422">Chapter 15</h1>
<p><span id="p423" class="sentence">A mild answer turns away rage,But a harsh word stirs up anger.</span>
<span id="p424" class="sentence">2  The tongue of the wise makes good use of knowledge,But the mouth of the stupid blurts out foolishness.</span>
<span id="p425" class="sentence">3  The eyes of Jehovah are everywhere,Watching both the bad and the good.</span>
<span id="p426" class="sentence">4  A calm tongue is a tree of life,But twisted speech causes despair.</span>
<span id="p427" class="sentence">5  A fool disrespects his father’s discipline,But a shrewd person accepts correction.</span>
<span id="p428" class="sentence">6  In the house of the righteous one there is abundant treasure,But the produce of the wicked one brings him trouble.</span>
<span id="p429" class="sentence">7  The lips of the wise spread knowledge,But not so the heart of the stupid one.</span>
<span id="p430" class="sentence">8  The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to Jehovah,But the prayer of the upright is a pleasure to Him.</span>
<span id="p431" class="sentence">9  Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one,But he loves the one who pursues righteousness.</span>
<span id="p432" class="sentence">10  Discipline seems bad to one forsaking the way,But whoever hates reproof will die.</span>
<span id="p433" class="sentence">11  The Grave and the place of destruction are in full view of Jehovah.
How much more so the hearts of men!</span>
<span id="p434" class="sentence">12  The scoffer does not love the one correcting him.
He will not consult the wise.</span>
<span id="p435" class="sentence">13  A joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance,But heartache crushes the spirit.</span>
<span id="p436" class="sentence">14  The understanding heart seeks knowledge,But the mouth of the stupid feeds on foolishness.</span>
<span id="p437" class="sentence">15  All the days of the afflicted one are bad,But the one with a cheerful heart has a continual feast.</span>
<span id="p438" class="sentence">16  Better is a little in the fear of JehovahThan great wealth along with anxiety.</span>
<span id="p439" class="sentence">17  Better is a dish of vegetables where there is loveThan a fattened bull where there is hatred.</span>
<span id="p440" class="sentence">18  A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,But one who is slow to anger calms a quarrel.</span>
<span id="p441" class="sentence">19  The way of the lazy one is like a hedge of thorns,But the path of the upright is like a level highway.</span>
<span id="p442" class="sentence">20  A wise son makes his father rejoice,But a stupid man despises his mother.</span>
<span id="p443" class="sentence">21  Foolishness is a joy to one lacking good sense,But the man of discernment walks straight ahead.</span>
<span id="p444" class="sentence">22  Plans fail when there is no consultation,But there is accomplishment through many advisers.</span>
<span id="p445" class="sentence">23  A man rejoices in giving the right answer,And a word spoken at the right time—how good it is!</span>
<span id="p446" class="sentence">24  The path of life leads upward to one with insight,To turn him away from the Grave below.</span>
<span id="p447" class="sentence">25  Jehovah will tear down the house of the haughty,But he will preserve the boundary of the widow.</span>
<span id="p448" class="sentence">26  Jehovah detests the schemes of the wicked one,But pleasant sayings are pure to Him.</span>
<span id="p449" class="sentence">27  The one making dishonest profit brings trouble on his own household,But the one hating bribes will keep living.</span>
<span id="p450" class="sentence">28  The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering,But the mouth of the wicked blurts out bad things.</span>
<span id="p451" class="sentence">29  Jehovah is far away from the wicked,But he hears the prayer of the righteous.</span>
<span id="p452" class="sentence">30  Bright eyes make the heart rejoice;A good report invigorates the bones.</span>
<span id="p453" class="sentence">31  The one who listens to life-giving reproofIs at home among the wise.</span>
<span id="p454" class="sentence">32  Anyone refusing discipline despises his life,But whoever listens to reproof acquires understanding.</span>
<span id="p455" class="sentence">33  The fear of Jehovah is a training in wisdom,And before glory there is humility.</span></p></level1>
