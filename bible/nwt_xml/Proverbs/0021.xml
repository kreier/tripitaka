<level1><h1 id="p605">Chapter 21</h1>
<p><span id="p606" class="sentence">A king’s heart is like streams of water in Jehovah’s hand.
He directs it wherever He pleases.</span>
<span id="p607" class="sentence">2  All of a man’s ways seem right to him,But Jehovah examines the hearts.</span>
<span id="p608" class="sentence">3  To do what is right and justIs more pleasing to Jehovah than a sacrifice.</span>
<span id="p609" class="sentence">4  Haughty eyes and an arrogant heart—The lamp that guides the wicked is sin.</span>
<span id="p610" class="sentence">5  The plans of the diligent surely lead to success,But all who are hasty surely head for poverty.</span>
<span id="p611" class="sentence">6  Gaining treasures by a lying tongueIs like a vanishing mist, a deadly snare.</span>
<span id="p612" class="sentence">7  The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,For they refuse to act with justice.</span>
<span id="p613" class="sentence">8  The way of a guilty man is crooked,But the activity of the pure man is upright.</span>
<span id="p614" class="sentence">9  Better to dwell on a corner of the roofThan in the same house with a quarrelsome wife.</span>
<span id="p615" class="sentence">10  The wicked man craves what is bad;He shows no favor toward his neighbor.</span>
<span id="p616" class="sentence">11  When a ridiculer is punished, the inexperienced become wiser,And when a wise person receives insight, he gains knowledge.</span>
<span id="p617" class="sentence">12  The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked one;He overthrows the wicked to their ruin.</span>
<span id="p618" class="sentence">13  Whoever stops up his ear to the cry of the lowly oneWill himself call and not be answered.</span>
<span id="p619" class="sentence">14  A secret gift subdues anger,And a hidden bribe, fierce rage.</span>
<span id="p620" class="sentence">15  It is a joy for the righteous one to act with justice,But it is something terrible to those who practice evil.</span>
<span id="p621" class="sentence">16  The man who strays from the way of insightWill rest in the company of those powerless in death.</span>
<span id="p622" class="sentence">17  The one who loves having a good time will come to poverty;The one who loves wine and oil will not grow rich.</span>
<span id="p623" class="sentence">18  The wicked one is a ransom for the righteous one,And the treacherous one will be taken in place of the upright.</span>
<span id="p624" class="sentence">19  Better to dwell in the wildernessThan with a quarrelsome and irritable wife.</span>
<span id="p625" class="sentence">20  Precious treasure and oil are found in the house of the wise,But the stupid man will squander what he has.</span>
<span id="p626" class="sentence">21  Whoever pursues righteousness and loyal loveWill find life, righteousness, and glory.</span>
<span id="p627" class="sentence">22  A wise man can scale the city of the mightyAnd undermine the strength in which they trust.</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">23  The one guarding his mouth and his tongueKeeps himself out of trouble.</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">24  A presumptuous, arrogant braggart is what you callThe man who acts with reckless presumptuousness.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">25  What the lazy man craves will put him to death,For his hands refuse to work.</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">26  All day long he greedily craves,But the righteous one gives, holding nothing back.</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">27  The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable.
How much more when he offers it with evil intent!</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">28  A lying witness will perish,But the man who listens will testify with success.</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">29  The wicked man puts on a bold face,But it is the upright one whose course is sure.</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">30  There is no wisdom, nor discernment, nor counsel in opposition to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">31  The horse is prepared for the day of battle,But salvation belongs to Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
