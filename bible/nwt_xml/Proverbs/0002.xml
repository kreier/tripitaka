<p><span id="p36" class="sentence">My son, if you accept my sayingsAnd treasure up my commandments,</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">2  By making your ear attentive to wisdomAnd inclining your heart to discernment;</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">3  Moreover, if you call out for understandingAnd raise your voice for discernment;</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">4  If you keep seeking for it as for silver,And you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures;</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">5  Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah,And you will find the knowledge of God.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">6  For Jehovah himself gives wisdom;From his mouth come knowledge and discernment.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">7  He treasures up practical wisdom for the upright;He is a shield for those walking in integrity.</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">8  He watches over the paths of justice,And he will guard the way of his loyal ones.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">9  Then you will understand what is righteous and just and fair,The entire course of what is good.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">10  When wisdom enters your heartAnd knowledge becomes pleasant to your soul,</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">11  Thinking ability will keep watch over you,And discernment will safeguard you,</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">12  To save you from the bad course,From the man speaking perverse things,</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">13  From those leaving the upright pathsTo walk in the ways of darkness,</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">14  From those who rejoice in wrongdoing,Who find joy in the perverseness of evil,</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">15  Those whose paths are crookedAnd whose entire course is devious.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">16  It will save you from the wayward woman,From the smooth words of the immoral woman,</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">17  Who abandons the close companion of her youthAnd forgets the covenant of her God;</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">18  For her house sinks down into death,And her paths lead to those powerless in death.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">19  None of those having relations with her will return,Nor will they regain the pathways of life.</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">20  So follow the way of good peopleAnd stay on the paths of the righteous,</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">21  For only the upright will reside in the earth,And the blameless will remain in it.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">22  As for the wicked, they will be cut off from the earth,And the treacherous will be torn away from it.</span></p></level1>
