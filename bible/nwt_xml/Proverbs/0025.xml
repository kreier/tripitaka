<level1><h1 id="p738">Chapter 25</h1>
<p><span id="p739" class="sentence">These also are the proverbs of Solʹo·mon, which the men of Hez·e·kiʹah the king of Judah transcribed:</span>
<span id="p740" class="sentence">2  It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret,And the glory of kings is to search through a matter.</span>
<span id="p741" class="sentence">3  As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,So the heart of kings is unsearchable.</span>
<span id="p742" class="sentence">4  Remove the dross from the silver,And it will emerge completely refined.</span>
<span id="p743" class="sentence">5  Remove the wicked one from the king’s presence,And his throne will be firmly established in righteousness.</span>
<span id="p744" class="sentence">6  Do not honor yourself before the king,And do not take a place among the prominent,</span>
<span id="p745" class="sentence">7  For it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
Than to humiliate you in the presence of a noble.</span>
<span id="p746" class="sentence">8  Do not rush into a legal dispute,For what will you do later if your neighbor humiliates you?</span>
<span id="p747" class="sentence">9  Plead your case with your neighbor,But do not reveal what you were told confidentially,</span>
<span id="p748" class="sentence">10  So that the one listening will not put you to shameAnd you spread a bad report that cannot be recalled.</span>
<span id="p749" class="sentence">11  Like apples of gold in silver carvingsIs a word spoken at the right time.</span>
<span id="p750" class="sentence">12  Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine goldIs a wise reprover to the receptive ear.</span>
<span id="p751" class="sentence">13  Just like the coldness of snow on the day of harvestIs a faithful messenger to those who sent him,For he refreshes his master.</span>
<span id="p752" class="sentence">14  Like clouds and wind that bring no rainIs a man who boasts about a gift never given.</span>
<span id="p753" class="sentence">15  By patience a commander is won over,And a gentle tongue can break a bone.</span>
<span id="p754" class="sentence">16  If you find honey, eat only what you need,For if you take too much, you may vomit it up.</span>
<span id="p755" class="sentence">17  Rarely set foot in your neighbor’s house,So that he does not get tired of you and hate you.</span>
<span id="p756" class="sentence">18  Like a war club and a sword and a sharp arrowIs a man bearing false witness against his neighbor.</span>
<span id="p757" class="sentence">19  Like a broken tooth or an unsteady footIs confidence in an unreliable person in times of trouble.</span>
<span id="p758" class="sentence">20  Like one who removes a garment on a cold dayAnd like vinegar poured on sodaIs the one who sings songs to a gloomy heart.</span>
<span id="p759" class="sentence">21  If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;If he is thirsty, give him water to drink,</span>
<span id="p760" class="sentence">22  For you will be heaping burning coals on his head,And Jehovah will reward you.</span>
<span id="p761" class="sentence">23  The north wind brings a downpour,And a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.</span>
<span id="p762" class="sentence">24  Better to dwell on a corner of the roofThan in the same house with a quarrelsome wife.</span>
<span id="p763" class="sentence">25  Like cold water on a tired soulIs a good report from a distant land.</span>
<span id="p764" class="sentence">26  Like a muddied spring and a ruined wellIs a righteous person who gives in to a wicked one.</span>
<span id="p765" class="sentence">27  It is not good to eat too much honey,Nor is it glorious to seek one’s own glory.</span>
<span id="p766" class="sentence">28  As a city broken through, without a wall,Is the man who cannot control his temper.</span></p></level1>
