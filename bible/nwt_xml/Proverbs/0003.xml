<level1><h1 id="p58">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p59" class="sentence">My son, do not forget my teaching,And may your heart observe my commandments,</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">2  Because they will add many daysAnd years of life and peace to you.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">3  Do not let loyal love and faithfulness leave you.
Tie them around your neck;Write them on the tablet of your heart;</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">4  Then you will find favor and good insightIn the eyes of God and man.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">5  Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,And do not rely on your own understanding.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">6  In all your ways take notice of him,And he will make your paths straight.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">7  Do not become wise in your own eyes.
Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">8  It will be a healing to your bodyAnd refreshment for your bones.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">9  Honor Jehovah with your valuable things,With the firstfruits of all your produce;</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">10  Then your storehouses will be completely filled,And your vats will overflow with new wine.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">11  My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah,And do not loathe his reproof,</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">12  For those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,Just as a father does a son in whom he delights.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">13  Happy is the man who finds wisdomAnd the man who acquires discernment;</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">14  To gain it is better than gaining silver,And having it as profit is better than having gold.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">15  It is more precious than corals;Nothing you desire can compare to it.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">16  Long life is in its right hand;Riches and glory are in its left hand.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">17  Its ways are pleasant,And all its paths are peaceful.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">18  It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it,And those who keep firm hold of it will be called happy.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">19  Jehovah founded the earth in wisdom.
He solidly established the heavens in discernment.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">20  By his knowledge the watery deeps were split apartAnd the cloudy skies dripped with dew.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">21  My son, do not lose sight of them.
Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability;</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">22  They will give you lifeAnd be an adornment for your neck;</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">23  Then you will walk on your way in safety,And your foot will never stumble.</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">24  When you lie down, you will have no fear;You will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">25  You will not fear any sudden terrorNor the storm that is coming on the wicked.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">26  For Jehovah will prove to be your source of confidence;He will keep your foot from being caught.</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">27  Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give itIf it is within your power to help.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">28  Do not say to your neighbor, “Go away; come back later! I will give it to you tomorrow,”
If you can give it now.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">29  Do not plot harm against your neighborWhen he lives in a sense of security with you.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">30  Do not quarrel with a man for no reasonIf he has done nothing bad to you.</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">31  Do not envy the violent manNor choose any of his ways,</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">32  For Jehovah detests a devious person,But His close friendship is with the upright.</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">33  The curse of Jehovah is on the house of the wicked one,But he blesses the home of the righteous.</span>
<span id="p92" class="sentence">34  For he mocks those who ridicule,But he shows favor to the meek.</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">35  The wise will inherit honor,But the stupid ones glorify dishonor.</span></p></level1>
