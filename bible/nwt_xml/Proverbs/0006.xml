<level1><h1 id="p146">Chapter 6</h1>
<p><span id="p147" class="sentence">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,If you have given your handshake to a stranger,</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">2  If you have been ensnared by your promise,Caught by the words of your mouth,</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">3  Do this, my son, and free yourself,For you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor:
Go and humble yourself and urgently plead with your neighbor.</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">4  Do not allow your eyes to sleep,Nor your eyelids to slumber.</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">5  Free yourself like a gazelle from the hunter’s hand,Like a bird from the hand of the birdcatcher.</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">6  Go to the ant, you lazy one;Observe its ways and become wise.</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">7  Although it has no commander, officer, or ruler,</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">8  It prepares its food in the summer,And it gathers its food supplies in the harvest.</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">9  How long, you lazy one, will you lie there?
When will you rise up from your sleep?</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">10  A little sleep, a little slumbering,A little folding of the hands to rest,</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">11  And your poverty will come like a bandit,And your want like an armed man.</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">12  A useless and wicked man walks about with crooked speech;</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">13  He winks with his eye, signals with his foot, and motions with his fingers.</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">14  With a perverted heart,He is always scheming evil and spreading contentions.</span>
<span id="p161" class="sentence">15  Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;In a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</span>
<span id="p162" class="sentence">16  There are six things that Jehovah hates;Yes, seven things that he detests:</span>
<span id="p163" class="sentence">17  Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</span>
<span id="p164" class="sentence">18  A heart plotting wicked schemes, and feet that run quickly to evil,</span>
<span id="p165" class="sentence">19  A false witness who lies with every breath,And anyone sowing contentions among brothers.</span>
<span id="p166" class="sentence">20  Observe, my son, the commandment of your father,And do not forsake the instruction of your mother.</span>
<span id="p167" class="sentence">21  Always bind them around your heart;Tie them about your neck.</span>
<span id="p168" class="sentence">22  When you walk about, it will lead you;When you lie down, it will stand guard over you;And when you awaken, it will speak to you.</span>
<span id="p169" class="sentence">23  For the commandment is a lamp,And the law is a light,And the reproofs of discipline are the way to life.</span>
<span id="p170" class="sentence">24  They will guard you against the bad woman,Against the seductive tongue of the immoral woman.</span>
<span id="p171" class="sentence">25  Do not desire her beauty in your heartOr allow her to captivate you with her alluring eyes,</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">26  For because of a prostitute, a man is reduced to a loaf of bread,But the wife of another man preys on a precious life.</span>
<span id="p173" class="sentence">27  Can a man rake fire to his chest and not burn his garments?</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">28  Or can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">29  It is the same with anyone having relations with his neighbor’s wife;No one who touches her will go unpunished.</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">30  People do not despise a thiefIf he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">31  Yet, when found, he will repay sevenfold;He will give up all the valuables of his house.</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">32  Anyone committing adultery with a woman is lacking good sense;The one who does so brings ruin on himself.</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">33  He will get only wounds and dishonor,And his disgrace will not be wiped away.</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">34  For jealousy makes a husband furious;He will show no compassion when he takes revenge.</span>
<span id="p181" class="sentence">35  He will accept no compensation;He will not be appeased, no matter how large you make the gift.</span></p></level1>
