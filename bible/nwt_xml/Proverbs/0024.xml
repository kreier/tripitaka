<level1><h1 id="p703">Chapter 24</h1>
<p><span id="p704" class="sentence">Do not envy evil men,And do not crave their company,</span>
<span id="p705" class="sentence">2  For their heart meditates on violence,And their lips speak of trouble.</span>
<span id="p706" class="sentence">3  By wisdom a house is built up,And by discernment it is made secure.</span>
<span id="p707" class="sentence">4  By knowledge its rooms are filledWith all sorts of precious and pleasant treasures.</span>
<span id="p708" class="sentence">5  A wise man is powerful,And with knowledge a man increases his power.</span>
<span id="p709" class="sentence">6  By skillful direction you will wage your war,And through many advisers there is victory.</span>
<span id="p710" class="sentence">7  True wisdom is unattainable for a fool;He has nothing to say in the city gate.</span>
<span id="p711" class="sentence">8  Anyone who plots evilWill be called a master schemer.</span>
<span id="p712" class="sentence">9  Foolish schemes are sinful,And people detest a ridiculer.</span>
<span id="p713" class="sentence">10  If you become discouraged in the day of distress,Your strength will be meager.</span>
<span id="p714" class="sentence">11  Rescue those who are being taken away to death,And hold back those staggering to the slaughter.</span>
<span id="p715" class="sentence">12  If you say, “But we did not know about this,”
Does not the One who examines hearts discern it?
Yes, the One who watches you will knowAnd will repay each man according to his activity.</span>
<span id="p716" class="sentence">13  My son, eat honey, because it is good;Honey from the comb is sweet to the taste.</span>
<span id="p717" class="sentence">14  Likewise, know that wisdom is good for you.
If you find it, you will have a futureAnd your hope will not be cut off.</span>
<span id="p718" class="sentence">15  Do not wickedly lie in ambush near the home of the righteous one;Do not destroy his place of rest.</span>
<span id="p719" class="sentence">16  For the righteous one may fall seven times, and he will get up again,But the wicked will be made to stumble by calamity.</span>
<span id="p720" class="sentence">17  When your enemy falls, do not rejoice,And when he stumbles, do not let your heart be joyful;</span>
<span id="p721" class="sentence">18  Otherwise, Jehovah will see and be displeased,And He will turn away his anger from him.</span>
<span id="p722" class="sentence">19  Do not be upset because of evil men;Do not envy wicked people,</span>
<span id="p723" class="sentence">20  For there is no future for anyone evil;The lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.</span>
<span id="p724" class="sentence">21  My son, fear Jehovah and the king.
And do not associate with dissenters,</span>
<span id="p725" class="sentence">22  For their disaster will arise suddenly.
Who knows what ruin both will bring upon them?</span>
<span id="p726" class="sentence">23  These sayings also belong to the wise:
Partiality in judgment is not good.</span>
<span id="p727" class="sentence">24  Whoever says to the wicked one, “You are righteous,”
Will be cursed by the peoples and denounced by the nations.</span>
<span id="p728" class="sentence">25  But it will go well for those reproving him;Blessings of good things will come upon them.</span>
<span id="p729" class="sentence">26  People will kiss the lips of the one replying honestly.</span>
<span id="p730" class="sentence">27  Prepare your outside work, and get everything ready in the field;Then build your house.</span>
<span id="p731" class="sentence">28  Do not testify against your neighbor without grounds.
Do not use your lips to deceive others.</span>
<span id="p732" class="sentence">29  Do not say: “I will do to him just as he has done to me;I will repay him for what he did.”</span>
<span id="p733" class="sentence">30  I passed by the field of the lazy one,By the vineyard of the man lacking good sense.</span>
<span id="p734" class="sentence">31  I saw that it was overgrown with weeds;The ground was covered with nettles,And its stone wall was broken down.</span>
<span id="p735" class="sentence">32  I observed this and took it to heart;I saw it and learned this lesson:</span>
<span id="p736" class="sentence">33  A little sleep, a little slumbering,A little folding of the hands to rest,</span>
<span id="p737" class="sentence">34  And your poverty will come like a bandit,And your want like an armed man.</span></p></level1>
