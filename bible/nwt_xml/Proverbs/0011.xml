<p><span id="p300" class="sentence">Dishonest scales are detestable to Jehovah,But an accurate weight brings pleasure to him.</span>
<span id="p301" class="sentence">2  When presumptuousness comes, dishonor will follow,But wisdom is with the modest ones.</span>
<span id="p302" class="sentence">3  The integrity of the upright is what guides them,But the deviousness of the treacherous will destroy them.</span>
<span id="p303" class="sentence">4  Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,But righteousness is what will rescue from death.</span>
<span id="p304" class="sentence">5  The righteousness of the blameless one makes his path straight,But the wicked one will fall because of his own wickedness.</span>
<span id="p305" class="sentence">6  The righteousness of the upright will rescue them,But the treacherous will be caught by their own desires.</span>
<span id="p306" class="sentence">7  When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes;And expectations based on his power also perish.</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">8  The righteous one is rescued from distress,And the wicked one takes his place.</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">9  By his mouth the apostate brings his neighbor to ruin,But by knowledge the righteous are rescued.</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">10  The goodness of the righteous makes a city rejoice,And when the wicked perish, there is a joyful cry.</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">11  Because of the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,But the mouth of the wicked tears it down.</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">12  Whoever is lacking good sense shows contempt for his neighbor,But the man of true discernment remains silent.</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">13  A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk,But the trustworthy person keeps a confidence.</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">14  When there is no skillful direction, the people fall,But there is success through many advisers.</span>
<span id="p314" class="sentence">15  Whoever guarantees a loan for a stranger is sure to fare badly,But whoever avoids shaking hands in a pledge will be secure.</span>
<span id="p315" class="sentence">16  A gracious woman acquires glory,But ruthless men seize riches.</span>
<span id="p316" class="sentence">17  A kind man benefits himself,But the cruel person brings trouble on himself.</span>
<span id="p317" class="sentence">18  The wicked one earns deceptive wages,But the one who sows righteousness receives a true reward.</span>
<span id="p318" class="sentence">19  The one standing firmly for righteousness is in line for life,But the one chasing after evil is in line for death.</span>
<span id="p319" class="sentence">20  Those crooked at heart are detestable to Jehovah,But those whose way is blameless bring pleasure to him.</span>
<span id="p320" class="sentence">21  Be assured of this: An evil person will not go unpunished,But the children of the righteous will escape.</span>
<span id="p321" class="sentence">22  Like a gold ring in the snout of a pigIs a beautiful woman who rejects good sense.</span>
<span id="p322" class="sentence">23  The desire of the righteous leads to good,But what the wicked hope for leads to fury.</span>
<span id="p323" class="sentence">24  One gives generously and ends up with more;Another withholds what should be given, but he comes to poverty.</span>
<span id="p324" class="sentence">25  The generous person will prosper,And whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.</span>
<span id="p325" class="sentence">26  The people will curse the one who withholds grain,But they will bless the one who sells it.</span>
<span id="p326" class="sentence">27  The one who diligently seeks to do good seeks favor,But the one searching for bad—that is what will surely come upon him.</span>
<span id="p327" class="sentence">28  The one trusting in his riches will fall,But the righteous will flourish like the foliage.</span>
<span id="p328" class="sentence">29  Anyone who brings trouble on his household will inherit the wind,And the fool will be a servant to the wisehearted one.</span>
<span id="p329" class="sentence">30  The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life,And the one who wins souls is wise.</span>
<span id="p330" class="sentence">31  If, indeed, the righteous one on earth is rewarded,How much more the wicked one and the sinner!</span></p></level1>
