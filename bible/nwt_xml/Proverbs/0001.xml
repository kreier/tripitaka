<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">The proverbs of Solʹo·mon, the son of David, the king of Israel:</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  To learn wisdom and discipline;To understand wise sayings;</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  To acquire the discipline that gives insight,Righteousness, good judgment, and uprightness;</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  To impart shrewdness to the inexperienced;To give a young man knowledge and thinking ability.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  A wise person listens and takes in more instruction;A man of understanding acquires skillful direction</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  To understand a proverb and a puzzling saying,The words of the wise and their riddles.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge.
Only fools despise wisdom and discipline.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father,And do not forsake the instruction of your mother.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  They are an attractive wreath for your headAnd a fine ornament for your neck.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  My son, if sinners try to entice you, do not consent.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  If they say: “Come with us.
Let us set an ambush to shed blood.
We will lie hidden, waiting for innocent victims without cause.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  We will swallow them alive as the Grave does,Whole, like those going down to the pit.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  Let us seize all their precious treasures;We will fill our houses with spoil.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  You should join us,And we will all share equally what we steal.”</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  My son, do not follow them.
Keep your feet off their path,</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  For their feet run to do evil;They hurry to shed blood.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  It is surely in vain to spread a net in full sight of a bird.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  That is why these lie in ambush to shed blood;They lie hidden to take the lives of others.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  These are the ways of those seeking dishonest profit,Which will take away the life of those who obtain it.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  True wisdom cries aloud in the street.
It keeps raising its voice in the public squares.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  At the corner of the busy streets it calls out.
At the entrances of the city gates it says:</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">22  “How long will you inexperienced ones love inexperience?
How long will you ridiculers take pleasure in ridicule?
And how long will you foolish ones hate knowledge?</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">23  Respond to my reproof.
Then I will pour out my spirit for you;I will make my words known to you.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">24  Because I called out, but you kept refusing,I stretched out my hand, but no one was paying attention,</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">25  You kept neglecting all my adviceAnd rejecting my reproof,</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">26  I also will laugh when disaster strikes you;I will mock when what you dread comes,</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">27  When what you dread comes like a storm,And your disaster arrives like a storm wind,When distress and trouble come upon you.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">28  At that time they will keep calling me, but I will not answer;They will eagerly look for me, but they will not find me,</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">29  Because they hated knowledge,And they did not choose to fear Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">30  They refused my advice;They disrespected all my reproof.</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">31  So they will bear the consequences of their way,And they will be glutted with their own counsel.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">32  For the waywardness of the inexperienced will kill them,And the complacency of fools will destroy them.</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">33  But the one listening to me will dwell in securityAnd be undisturbed by the dread of calamity.”</span></p></level1>
