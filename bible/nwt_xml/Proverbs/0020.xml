<level1><h1 id="p574">Chapter 20</h1>
<p><span id="p575" class="sentence">Wine is a ridiculer, alcohol is unruly;Whoever goes astray by them is not wise.</span>
<span id="p576" class="sentence">2  The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion;Whoever provokes his anger risks his own life.</span>
<span id="p577" class="sentence">3  It is honorable for a man to refrain from a dispute,But every fool will become embroiled in it.</span>
<span id="p578" class="sentence">4  The lazy one does not plow in winter,So he will be begging during the harvest when he has nothing.</span>
<span id="p579" class="sentence">5  The thoughts of a man’s heart are like deep waters,But the discerning man draws them out.</span>
<span id="p580" class="sentence">6  Many men proclaim their loyal love,But who can find a faithful man?</span>
<span id="p581" class="sentence">7  The righteous one is walking in his integrity.
Happy are his children who come after him.</span>
<span id="p582" class="sentence">8  When the king sits on the throne to judge,He sifts out all evil with his eyes.</span>
<span id="p583" class="sentence">9  Who can say: “I have cleansed my heart;I am pure from my sin”?</span>
<span id="p584" class="sentence">10  Dishonest weights and false measures—Both are detestable to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p585" class="sentence">11  Even a child is known by his actions,Whether his behavior is pure and right.</span>
<span id="p586" class="sentence">12  The hearing ear and the seeing eye—Jehovah has made both of them.</span>
<span id="p587" class="sentence">13  Do not love sleep, or you will come to poverty.
Open your eyes, and you will be satisfied with bread.</span>
<span id="p588" class="sentence">14  “It is no good, it is no good!” says the buyer;Then he goes away and boasts about himself.</span>
<span id="p589" class="sentence">15  There is gold, also much coral,But the lips of knowledge are something precious.</span>
<span id="p590" class="sentence">16  Take a man’s garment if he has given security for a stranger;Seize the pledge from him if he did so for a foreign woman.</span>
<span id="p591" class="sentence">17  Bread gained by deceit tastes good to a man,But afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.</span>
<span id="p592" class="sentence">18  By consultation, plans will succeed,And by skillful direction wage your war.</span>
<span id="p593" class="sentence">19  A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk;Do not associate with one who loves to gossip.</span>
<span id="p594" class="sentence">20  Whoever curses his father and his mother,His lamp will be extinguished when darkness comes.</span>
<span id="p595" class="sentence">21  An inheritance obtained first by greedWill not be a blessing in the end.</span>
<span id="p596" class="sentence">22  Do not say: “I will pay back evil!”
Hope in Jehovah, and he will save you.</span>
<span id="p597" class="sentence">23  Dishonest weights are detestable to Jehovah,And deceptive scales are not good.</span>
<span id="p598" class="sentence">24  A man’s footsteps are directed by Jehovah;How can a man understand his own way?</span>
<span id="p599" class="sentence">25  It is a snare for a man to cry out rashly, “Holy!”
And only later to give consideration to what he vowed.</span>
<span id="p600" class="sentence">26  A wise king sifts out the wickedAnd drives the threshing wheel over them.</span>
<span id="p601" class="sentence">27  The breath of a man is the lamp of Jehovah,Searching through his innermost being.</span>
<span id="p602" class="sentence">28  Loyal love and faithfulness safeguard the king;By loyal love he sustains his throne.</span>
<span id="p603" class="sentence">29  The glory of young men is their strength,And the splendor of old men is their gray hair.</span>
<span id="p604" class="sentence">30  Bruises and wounds purge away evil,And beatings cleanse one’s innermost being.</span></p></level1>
