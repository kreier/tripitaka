<level1><h1 id="p853">Chapter 29</h1>
<p><span id="p854" class="sentence">A man who stiffens his neck after much reproofWill suddenly be broken beyond healing.</span>
<span id="p855" class="sentence">2  When the righteous are many, the people rejoice,But when the wicked one rules, the people groan.</span>
<span id="p856" class="sentence">3  A man who loves wisdom makes his father rejoice,But the one who keeps company with prostitutes squanders his wealth.</span>
<span id="p857" class="sentence">4  By justice a king brings stability to a land,But a man seeking bribes brings it to ruin.</span>
<span id="p858" class="sentence">5  A man who flatters his neighborSpreads out a net for his feet.</span>
<span id="p859" class="sentence">6  A bad man’s transgression ensnares him,But the righteous one cries out joyfully and rejoices.</span>
<span id="p860" class="sentence">7  The righteous one is concerned about the legal rights of the poor,But the wicked one has no such concern.</span>
<span id="p861" class="sentence">8  Boastful men inflame a town,But those who are wise turn away anger.</span>
<span id="p862" class="sentence">9  When a wise man enters into a controversy with a fool,There will be ranting and ridicule, but no satisfaction.</span>
<span id="p863" class="sentence">10  Bloodthirsty men hate anyone innocent,And they seek to take the life of the upright.</span>
<span id="p864" class="sentence">11  A stupid person gives vent to all his feelings,But the wise one calmly keeps them in check.</span>
<span id="p865" class="sentence">12  When a ruler pays attention to lies,All his servants will be wicked.</span>
<span id="p866" class="sentence">13  The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
Jehovah gives light to the eyes of both.</span>
<span id="p867" class="sentence">14  When a king judges the poor fairly,His throne will always be secure.</span>
<span id="p868" class="sentence">15  The rod and reproof impart wisdom,But a child left unrestrained brings shame on his mother.</span>
<span id="p869" class="sentence">16  When the wicked increase, transgression increases,But the righteous will see their downfall.</span>
<span id="p870" class="sentence">17  Discipline your son and he will bring you rest;And he will give you great pleasure.</span>
<span id="p871" class="sentence">18  Where there is no vision, the people go unrestrained,But happy are those who observe the law.</span>
<span id="p872" class="sentence">19  A servant will not let himself be corrected by words,For though he understands, he does not obey.</span>
<span id="p873" class="sentence">20  Have you seen a man hasty with his words?
There is more hope for a fool than for him.</span>
<span id="p874" class="sentence">21  If a servant is pampered from his youth,He will become thankless later on.</span>
<span id="p875" class="sentence">22  A man prone to anger stirs up strife;Anyone disposed to rage commits many transgressions.</span>
<span id="p876" class="sentence">23  The haughtiness of a man will humble him,But whoever is humble in spirit will obtain glory.</span>
<span id="p877" class="sentence">24  The partner of a thief hates himself.
He may hear the call to testify, but he reports nothing.</span>
<span id="p878" class="sentence">25  Trembling at men is a snare,But the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected.</span>
<span id="p879" class="sentence">26  Many seek an audience with a ruler,But it is from Jehovah that a man gets justice.</span>
<span id="p880" class="sentence">27  An unjust man is detestable to the righteous,But the one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked one.</span></p></level1>
