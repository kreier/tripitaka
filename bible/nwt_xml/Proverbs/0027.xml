<level1><h1 id="p796">Chapter 27</h1>
<p><span id="p797" class="sentence">Do not boast about tomorrow,For you do not know what a day will bring.</span>
<span id="p798" class="sentence">2  Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth;Others, and not your own lips.</span>
<span id="p799" class="sentence">3  A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,But the irritation caused by a fool is heavier than both.</span>
<span id="p800" class="sentence">4  There is the cruelty of rage and the flood of anger,But who can withstand jealousy?</span>
<span id="p801" class="sentence">5  Open reproof is better than concealed love.</span>
<span id="p802" class="sentence">6  The wounds inflicted by a friend are faithful,But an enemy’s kisses are plentiful.</span>
<span id="p803" class="sentence">7  One whose appetite is satisfied turns down honey from the comb,But to the hungry, even what is bitter tastes sweet.</span>
<span id="p804" class="sentence">8  Like a bird that strays from its nestIs a man who strays from his home.</span>
<span id="p805" class="sentence">9  Oil and incense make the heart rejoice;So does sweet friendship springing from sincere counsel.</span>
<span id="p806" class="sentence">10  Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend,And do not enter your own brother’s house on the day of your disaster;Better is a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.</span>
<span id="p807" class="sentence">11  Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice,So that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.</span>
<span id="p808" class="sentence">12  The shrewd person sees the danger and conceals himself,But the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.</span>
<span id="p809" class="sentence">13  Take a man’s garment if he has given security for a stranger;Seize the pledge from him if he did so for a foreign woman.</span>
<span id="p810" class="sentence">14  When someone blesses his fellow man with a loud voice early in the morning,It will be counted as a curse to him.</span>
<span id="p811" class="sentence">15  A quarrelsome wife is like a constantly leaking roof on a rainy day.</span>
<span id="p812" class="sentence">16  Whoever can restrain her can restrain the windAnd can grip oil with his right hand.</span>
<span id="p813" class="sentence">17  As iron sharpens iron,So one man sharpens his friend.</span>
<span id="p814" class="sentence">18  The one who cares for a fig tree will eat its fruit,And the one who takes care of his master will be honored.</span>
<span id="p815" class="sentence">19  As water reflects one’s face,So the heart of one man reflects another’s.</span>
<span id="p816" class="sentence">20  The Grave and the place of destruction are never satisfied,Nor are a man’s eyes ever satisfied.</span>
<span id="p817" class="sentence">21  As the refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,So a person is tested by the praise he receives.</span>
<span id="p818" class="sentence">22  Even if you pound a fool with a pestleLike crushed grain in a mortar,His foolishness will not leave him.</span>
<span id="p819" class="sentence">23  You should know well the appearance of your flock.
Take good care of your sheep,</span>
<span id="p820" class="sentence">24  For wealth does not last forever,Nor a crown for all generations.</span>
<span id="p821" class="sentence">25  The green grass disappears, new grass appears,And the vegetation of the mountains is gathered in.</span>
<span id="p822" class="sentence">26  The young rams provide your clothing,And the male goats provide the price of a field.</span>
<span id="p823" class="sentence">27  And there will be enough goat’s milk to feed you,To feed your household, and to sustain your servant girls.</span></p></level1>
