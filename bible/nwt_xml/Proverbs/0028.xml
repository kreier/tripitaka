<level1><h1 id="p824">Chapter 28</h1>
<p><span id="p825" class="sentence">The wicked flee when no one pursues them,But the righteous are as confident as a lion.</span>
<span id="p826" class="sentence">2  When there is transgression in the land, it will have one prince after another,But with the help of a man of discernment and knowledge, a prince will long endure.</span>
<span id="p827" class="sentence">3  A poor man who defrauds the lowlyIs like a rain that sweeps away all the food.</span>
<span id="p828" class="sentence">4  Those who abandon the law praise the wicked one,But those who observe the law are indignant with them.</span>
<span id="p829" class="sentence">5  Evil men cannot understand justice,But those who seek Jehovah can understand everything.</span>
<span id="p830" class="sentence">6  Better is a poor man who walks in his integrityThan a rich man whose ways are corrupt.</span>
<span id="p831" class="sentence">7  An understanding son observes the law,But a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.</span>
<span id="p832" class="sentence">8  The one who increases his wealth by interest and usuryAmasses it for the one who shows favor to the poor.</span>
<span id="p833" class="sentence">9  The one refusing to listen to the law—Even his prayer is detestable.</span>
<span id="p834" class="sentence">10  The one misleading the upright into an evil course will fall into his own pit,But the blameless will inherit what is good.</span>
<span id="p835" class="sentence">11  A rich man is wise in his own eyes,But a poor man with discernment can see through him.</span>
<span id="p836" class="sentence">12  When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,But when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.</span>
<span id="p837" class="sentence">13  The one covering over his transgressions will not succeed,But whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy.</span>
<span id="p838" class="sentence">14  Happy is the man who is always on guard,But whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity.</span>
<span id="p839" class="sentence">15  Like a growling lion and a charging bearIs a wicked ruler over a helpless people.</span>
<span id="p840" class="sentence">16  A leader without discernment abuses his power,But the one hating dishonest profit will prolong his life.</span>
<span id="p841" class="sentence">17  A man burdened with bloodguilt for taking someone’s life will keep fleeing until the grave.
Let no one support him.</span>
<span id="p842" class="sentence">18  The one walking faultlessly will be saved,But the one whose ways are crooked will suddenly fall.</span>
<span id="p843" class="sentence">19  The one cultivating his ground will have plenty of bread,But the one taking up worthless pursuits will have his fill of poverty.</span>
<span id="p844" class="sentence">20  A faithful man will receive many blessings,But the one hastening to get rich will not remain innocent.</span>
<span id="p845" class="sentence">21  It is not good to show partiality;But a man might do wrong for a piece of bread.</span>
<span id="p846" class="sentence">22  An envious man is eager for wealth,Not knowing that poverty will overtake him.</span>
<span id="p847" class="sentence">23  Whoever reproves a man will afterward find more favorThan someone who flatters with his tongue.</span>
<span id="p848" class="sentence">24  Whoever robs his father and mother and says, “It is not wrong,”
Is a partner of the man who causes ruin.</span>
<span id="p849" class="sentence">25  The greedy person stirs up dissension,But whoever relies on Jehovah will prosper.</span>
<span id="p850" class="sentence">26  Whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid,But the one who walks in wisdom will escape.</span>
<span id="p851" class="sentence">27  Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing,But the one who closes his eyes to them will receive many curses.</span>
<span id="p852" class="sentence">28  When the wicked rise to power, a man hides himself,But when they perish, the righteous increase.</span></p></level1>
