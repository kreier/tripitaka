<level1><h1 id="p490">Chapter 17</h1>
<p><span id="p491" class="sentence">Better is a piece of dry bread where there is peaceThan a house full of feasting along with quarreling.</span>
<span id="p492" class="sentence">2  A servant with insight will rule over a son who acts shamefully;He will share in the inheritance as one of the brothers.</span>
<span id="p493" class="sentence">3  The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,But Jehovah is the examiner of hearts.</span>
<span id="p494" class="sentence">4  A wicked man pays attention to hurtful speech,And a deceptive man listens to a malicious tongue.</span>
<span id="p495" class="sentence">5  Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker,And whoever rejoices over another’s disaster will not go unpunished.</span>
<span id="p496" class="sentence">6  Grandsons are a crown to the aged,And fathers are the glory of their sons.</span>
<span id="p497" class="sentence">7  Upright speech does not befit a fool.
How much less does false speech befit a ruler!</span>
<span id="p498" class="sentence">8  A gift is like a precious stone to its owner;Everywhere he turns, it brings him success.</span>
<span id="p499" class="sentence">9  Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love,But the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.</span>
<span id="p500" class="sentence">10  A rebuke makes a deeper impression on one having understandingThan striking a stupid person a hundred times.</span>
<span id="p501" class="sentence">11  A bad man seeks only rebellion,But a cruel messenger will be sent to punish him.</span>
<span id="p502" class="sentence">12  Better to meet a bear bereaved of her cubsThan to encounter someone stupid in his foolishness.</span>
<span id="p503" class="sentence">13  If anyone repays bad for good,Bad will not depart from his house.</span>
<span id="p504" class="sentence">14  Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate;Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.</span>
<span id="p505" class="sentence">15  Anyone who acquits the wicked one and anyone who condemns the righteous one—Both of them are detestable to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p506" class="sentence">16  What good is it that the stupid one has the means to acquire wisdomWhen he has no heart for acquiring it?</span>
<span id="p507" class="sentence">17  A true friend shows love at all timesAnd is a brother who is born for times of distress.</span>
<span id="p508" class="sentence">18  A man lacking good sense shakes hands and agreesTo put up security in the presence of his neighbor.</span>
<span id="p509" class="sentence">19  The one who loves conflict loves transgression.
Anyone who makes his entryway high invites a crash.</span>
<span id="p510" class="sentence">20  The one who is crooked at heart will not find success,And the one who speaks deceitfully will fall into ruin.</span>
<span id="p511" class="sentence">21  The one who fathers a stupid child will experience grief;And the father of a senseless child has no joy.</span>
<span id="p512" class="sentence">22  A joyful heart is good medicine,But a crushed spirit saps one’s strength.</span>
<span id="p513" class="sentence">23  A wicked man will take a bribe in secretTo pervert the course of justice.</span>
<span id="p514" class="sentence">24  Wisdom is directly in front of the discerning person,But the eyes of the stupid wander to the ends of the earth.</span>
<span id="p515" class="sentence">25  A stupid son brings grief to his fatherAnd heartache to the one who gave birth to him.</span>
<span id="p516" class="sentence">26  To punish the righteous one is not good,And to flog honorable people goes against what is right.</span>
<span id="p517" class="sentence">27  A man of knowledge restrains his words,And a discerning man will remain calm.</span>
<span id="p518" class="sentence">28  Even a fool who keeps silent will be considered wise,And the one who seals his lips, discerning.</span></p></level1>
