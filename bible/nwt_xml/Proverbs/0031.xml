<level1><h1 id="p915">Chapter 31</h1>
<p><span id="p916" class="sentence">The words of King Lemʹu·el, the weighty message his mother gave to instruct him:</span>
<span id="p917" class="sentence">2  What should I tell you, O my son,What, O son of my womb,And what, O son of my vows?</span>
<span id="p918" class="sentence">3  Do not give your vigor to women,Nor follow ways that destroy kings.</span>
<span id="p919" class="sentence">4  It is not for kings, O Lemʹu·el,It is not for kings to drink wineNor for rulers to say, “Where is my drink?”</span>
<span id="p920" class="sentence">5  So that they do not drink and forget what is decreedAnd pervert the rights of the lowly ones.</span>
<span id="p921" class="sentence">6  Give alcohol to those who are perishingAnd wine to those in bitter distress.</span>
<span id="p922" class="sentence">7  Let them drink and forget their poverty;Let them remember their trouble no more.</span>
<span id="p923" class="sentence">8  Speak up in behalf of the speechless;Defend the rights of all who are perishing.</span>
<span id="p924" class="sentence">9  Speak up and judge righteously;Defend the rights of the lowly and the poor.</span>
<span id="p925" class="sentence">10  Who can find a capable wife?
Her value is far more than that of corals.</span>
<span id="p926" class="sentence">11  Her husband trusts her from his heart,And he lacks nothing of value.</span>
<span id="p927" class="sentence">12  She rewards him with good, not bad,All the days of her life.</span>
<span id="p928" class="sentence">13  She obtains wool and linen;She delights to work with her hands.</span>
<span id="p929" class="sentence">14  She is like the ships of a merchant,Bringing her food in from afar.</span>
<span id="p930" class="sentence">15  She also rises while it is still night,Providing food for her householdAnd portions for her female servants.</span>
<span id="p931" class="sentence">16  She sets her mind on a field and buys it;She plants a vineyard from her own labors.</span>
<span id="p932" class="sentence">17  She prepares herself for hard work,And she strengthens her arms.</span>
<span id="p933" class="sentence">18  She sees that her trading is profitable;Her lamp does not go out at night.</span>
<span id="p934" class="sentence">19  Her hands seize the distaff,And her hands take hold of the spindle.</span>
<span id="p935" class="sentence">20  She extends her palm to the lowly one,And she opens her hands to the poor.</span>
<span id="p936" class="sentence">21  She does not worry about her household because of the snow,For her whole household is clothed in warm garments.</span>
<span id="p937" class="sentence">22  She makes her own bed covers.
Her clothing is of linen and purple wool.</span>
<span id="p938" class="sentence">23  Her husband is well-known in the city gates,Where he sits among the elders of the land.</span>
<span id="p939" class="sentence">24  She makes and sells linen garmentsAnd supplies belts to the merchants.</span>
<span id="p940" class="sentence">25  She is clothed with strength and splendor,And she looks to the future with confidence.</span>
<span id="p941" class="sentence">26  She opens her mouth in wisdom;The law of kindness is on her tongue.</span>
<span id="p942" class="sentence">27  She watches over the activity of her household,And the bread of laziness she does not eat.</span>
<span id="p943" class="sentence">28  Her children rise up and declare her happy;Her husband rises up and praises her.</span>
<span id="p944" class="sentence">29  There are many capable women,But you—you surpass them all.</span>
<span id="p945" class="sentence">30  Charm may be false, and beauty may be fleeting,But the woman who fears Jehovah will be praised.</span>
<span id="p946" class="sentence">31  Give her the reward for what she does,And let her works praise her in the city gates.</span></p></level1>
