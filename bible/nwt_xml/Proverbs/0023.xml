<level1><h1 id="p667">Chapter 23</h1>
<p><span id="p668" class="sentence">When you sit down to eat with a king,Carefully consider what is before you;</span>
<span id="p669" class="sentence">2  Put a knife to your throatIf you have a large appetite.</span>
<span id="p670" class="sentence">3  Do not crave his delicacies,For it is deceptive food.</span>
<span id="p671" class="sentence">4  Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.
Stop and show understanding.</span>
<span id="p672" class="sentence">5  When you cast your eyes on it, it is not there,For it will surely sprout wings like an eagle and fly off into the sky.</span>
<span id="p673" class="sentence">6  Do not eat the food of a stingy person;Do not crave his delicacies,</span>
<span id="p674" class="sentence">7  For he is like one keeping accounts.
“Eat and drink,” he says to you, but he does not mean it.</span>
<span id="p675" class="sentence">8  You will vomit up the morsels you have eatenAnd will have wasted your compliments.</span>
<span id="p676" class="sentence">9  Do not speak in the ears of the stupid one,For he will despise the wisdom of your words.</span>
<span id="p677" class="sentence">10  Do not move an ancient boundary markerOr encroach on the field of the fatherless.</span>
<span id="p678" class="sentence">11  For their Defender is strong;He will take up their cause against you.</span>
<span id="p679" class="sentence">12  Apply your heart to disciplineAnd your ear to the sayings of knowledge.</span>
<span id="p680" class="sentence">13  Do not hold back discipline from a boy.
If you strike him with the rod, he will not die.</span>
<span id="p681" class="sentence">14  With the rod you should strike him,In order to save him from the Grave.</span>
<span id="p682" class="sentence">15  My son, if your heart becomes wise,Then my own heart will rejoice.</span>
<span id="p683" class="sentence">16  My innermost being will find joyWhen your lips speak what is right.</span>
<span id="p684" class="sentence">17  Let your heart not envy sinners,But be in the fear of Jehovah all day long,</span>
<span id="p685" class="sentence">18  For then you will have a futureAnd your hope will not be cut off.</span>
<span id="p686" class="sentence">19  Listen, my son, and become wise,And direct your heart in the right way.</span>
<span id="p687" class="sentence">20  Do not be among those who drink too much wine,Among those who gorge themselves on meat,</span>
<span id="p688" class="sentence">21  For a drunkard and a glutton will come to poverty,And drowsiness will clothe one with rags.</span>
<span id="p689" class="sentence">22  Listen to your father who caused your birth,And do not despise your mother just because she has grown old.</span>
<span id="p690" class="sentence">23  Buy truth and never sell it,Also wisdom and discipline and understanding.</span>
<span id="p691" class="sentence">24  The father of a righteous one will surely be joyful;Whoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him.</span>
<span id="p692" class="sentence">25  Your father and your mother will rejoice,And she who gave birth to you will be joyful.</span>
<span id="p693" class="sentence">26  My son, do give your heart to me,And may your eyes take pleasure in my ways.</span>
<span id="p694" class="sentence">27  For a prostitute is a deep pit,And an immoral woman is a narrow well.</span>
<span id="p695" class="sentence">28  She lies in wait like a robber;She increases the number of unfaithful men.</span>
<span id="p696" class="sentence">29  Who has woe? Who has uneasiness?
Who has quarrels? Who has complaints?
Who has wounds for no reason? Who has bleary eyes?</span>
<span id="p697" class="sentence">30  Those lingering long over wine;Those searching out mixed wine.</span>
<span id="p698" class="sentence">31  Do not look at the wine’s red colorAs it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly,</span>
<span id="p699" class="sentence">32  For in the end it bites like a serpent,And it secretes poison like a viper.</span>
<span id="p700" class="sentence">33  Your eyes will see strange things,And your heart will speak perverse things.</span>
<span id="p701" class="sentence">34  And you will be like one lying down in the middle of the sea,Like one lying at the top of a ship’s mast.</span>
<span id="p702" class="sentence">35  You will say: “They have struck me, but I did not feel it.
They beat me, but I did not know it.
When will I wake up?
I need another drink.”</span></p></level1>
