<p><span id="p105" class="sentence">Working together with him, we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">2  For he says: “In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.” Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">3  In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, so that no fault may be found with our ministry;</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">4  but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by times of need, by difficulties,</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">5  by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by hard work, by sleepless nights, by times without food;</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">6  by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by holy spirit, by love free from hypocrisy,</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">7  by truthful speech, by God’s power; through the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left,</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">8  through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report. We are regarded as deceivers and yet we are truthful,</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">9  as unknown and yet we are recognized, as dying and yet look! we live, as punished and yet not handed over to death,</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">10  as sorrowing but ever rejoicing, as poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">11  We have opened our mouth to speak to you, Corinthians, and we have opened wide our heart.</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">12  We are not restricted in our affections for you, but you are restricted in your own tender affections for us.</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">13  So in response—I speak as to my children—you too open your hearts wide.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">14  Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness?</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">15  Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Beʹli·al? Or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever?</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">16  And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols? For we are a temple of a living God; just as God said: “I will reside among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">17  “‘Therefore, get out from among them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing’”; “‘and I will take you in.’”</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">18  “‘And I will become a father to you, and you will become sons and daughters to me,’ says Jehovah, the Almighty.”</span></p></level1>
