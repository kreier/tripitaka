<level1><h1 id="p898">Chapter 32</h1>
<p><span id="p899" class="sentence">“Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak,And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.</span>
<span id="p900" class="sentence">2  My instruction will fall as the rain;My words will trickle as the dew,As gentle rains upon grassAnd as copious showers upon vegetation.</span>
<span id="p901" class="sentence">3  For I will declare the name of Jehovah.
Tell about the greatness of our God!</span>
<span id="p902" class="sentence">4  The Rock, perfect is his activity,For all his ways are justice.
A God of faithfulness who is never unjust;Righteous and upright is he.</span>
<span id="p903" class="sentence">5  They are the ones who have acted corruptly.
They are not his children, the defect is their own.
They are a crooked and twisted generation!</span>
<span id="p904" class="sentence">6  Is this the way that you should treat Jehovah,O foolish and unwise people?
Is he not your Father who caused your existence,The One who made you and firmly established you?</span>
<span id="p905" class="sentence">7  Remember the days of old;Consider the years of past generations.
Ask your father, and he can tell you;Your elders, and they will inform you.</span>
<span id="p906" class="sentence">8  When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,When he divided the sons of Adam from one another,He fixed the boundary of the peoplesWith regard for the number of the sons of Israel.</span>
<span id="p907" class="sentence">9  For Jehovah’s people are his portion;Jacob is his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p908" class="sentence">10  He found him in a wilderness landAnd in an empty, howling desert.
He protectively encircled him, took care of him,And safeguarded him as the pupil of his eye.</span>
<span id="p909" class="sentence">11  Just as an eagle stirs up its nest,Hovers over its fledglings,Spreading out its wings, taking them,Carrying them on its pinions,</span>
<span id="p910" class="sentence">12  Jehovah alone kept leading him;No foreign god was with him.</span>
<span id="p911" class="sentence">13  He made him ride upon earth’s high places,So that he ate the produce of the field.
He nourished him with honey from the cragAnd oil out of a flinty rock,</span>
<span id="p912" class="sentence">14  Butter of the herd and milk of the flock,Together with the choicest sheep,And rams of Baʹshan, and he-goats,Together with the finest wheat;And you drank wine from the blood of grapes.</span>
<span id="p913" class="sentence">15  When Jeshʹu·run grew fat, he kicked out rebelliously.
You have grown fat, you have become stout, you have become bloated.
So he forsook God, who made him,And despised the Rock of his salvation.</span>
<span id="p914" class="sentence">16  They incited him to fury with foreign gods;They were offending him with detestable things.</span>
<span id="p915" class="sentence">17  They were sacrificing to demons, not to God,To gods that they had not known,New ones that came along recently,To gods that your forefathers did not know.</span>
<span id="p916" class="sentence">18  You forgot the Rock who fathered you,And you did not remember the God who gave birth to you.</span>
<span id="p917" class="sentence">19  When Jehovah saw it, he rejected themBecause his sons and his daughters offended him.</span>
<span id="p918" class="sentence">20  So he said, ‘I will hide my face from them;I will see what will become of them.
For they are a perverse generation,Sons in whom there is no faithfulness.</span>
<span id="p919" class="sentence">21  They have incited me to fury with what is not a god;They have offended me with their worthless idols.
So I will incite them to jealousy with what is not a people;I will offend them with a foolish nation.</span>
<span id="p920" class="sentence">22  For my anger has kindled a fireThat will burn to the depths of the Grave,And it will consume the earth and its produceAnd will set ablaze the foundations of mountains.</span>
<span id="p921" class="sentence">23  I will increase their calamities;I will use up my arrows on them.</span>
<span id="p922" class="sentence">24  They will be exhausted from hungerAnd eaten up by burning fever and bitter destruction.
I will send the teeth of beasts against themAnd the venom of reptiles of the dust.</span>
<span id="p923" class="sentence">25  Outside, a sword will bereave them;Inside, there is terrorFor both young man and virgin,Infant together with gray-haired man.</span>
<span id="p924" class="sentence">26  I would have said: “I will scatter them;I will make the memory of them cease from among men,”</span>
<span id="p925" class="sentence">27  If not for my dread of the enemy’s reaction,Because the adversaries might misconstrue it.
They might say: “Our power has triumphed;It was not Jehovah who did all of this.”</span>
<span id="p926" class="sentence">28  For they are a nation devoid of sense,And there is no understanding among them.</span>
<span id="p927" class="sentence">29  If only they were wise! They would ponder over this.
They would think about their outcome.</span>
<span id="p928" class="sentence">30  How could one chase after 1,000,And two put 10,000 to flight?
Not unless their Rock had sold themAnd Jehovah had surrendered them.</span>
<span id="p929" class="sentence">31  For their rock is not like our Rock,Even our enemies have understood this.</span>
<span id="p930" class="sentence">32  For their vine is from the vine of SodʹomAnd from the terraces of Go·morʹrah.
Their grapes are grapes of poison,Their clusters are bitter.</span>
<span id="p931" class="sentence">33  Their wine is the venom of serpents,The cruel poison of cobras.</span>
<span id="p932" class="sentence">34  Is this not stored up with me,Sealed up in my storehouse?</span>
<span id="p933" class="sentence">35  Vengeance is mine, and retribution,At the appointed time when their foot slips,For the day of their disaster is near,And what awaits them will come quickly.’</span>
<span id="p934" class="sentence">36  For Jehovah will judge his people,And he will feel pity for his servantsWhen he sees that their strength has waned,And that only the helpless and weak remain.</span>
<span id="p935" class="sentence">37  Then he will say, ‘Where are their gods,The rock in whom they sought refuge,</span>
<span id="p936" class="sentence">38  Who used to eat the fat of their sacrifices,To drink the wine of their drink offerings?
Let them rise up and help you.
Let them become your place of refuge.</span>
<span id="p937" class="sentence">39  See now that I—I am he,And there are no gods apart from me.
I put to death, and I make alive.
I wound, and I will heal,And no one can rescue from my hand.</span>
<span id="p938" class="sentence">40  For I raise my hand to heaven,And I swear: “As surely as I live forever,”</span>
<span id="p939" class="sentence">41  If I sharpen my flashing swordAnd prepare my hand for judgment,I will pay back vengeance on my adversariesAnd bring retribution to those who hate me.</span>
<span id="p940" class="sentence">42  I will make my arrows drunk with blood,And my sword will eat flesh,With the blood of the slain and the captives,With the heads of the leaders of the enemy.’</span>
<span id="p941" class="sentence">43  Be glad, you nations, with his people,For he will avenge the blood of his servants,And he will repay vengeance to his adversariesAnd will make atonement for the land of his people.”</span>
<span id="p942" class="sentence">44  Thus Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Ho·sheʹa the son of Nun.</span>
<span id="p943" class="sentence">45  After Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,</span>
<span id="p944" class="sentence">46  he said to them: “Take to heart all the words of my warning to you today, so that you may command your sons to take care to do all the words of this Law.</span>
<span id="p945" class="sentence">47  For this is no empty word for you, but it means your life, and by this word you may live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”</span>
<span id="p946" class="sentence">48  Jehovah spoke to Moses on this same day, saying:</span>
<span id="p947" class="sentence">49  “Go up into this mountain of Abʹa·rim, Mount Neʹbo, which is in the land of Moʹab, which faces toward Jerʹi·cho, and view the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as a possession.</span>
<span id="p948" class="sentence">50  Then you will die on the mountain you are about to ascend, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,</span>
<span id="p949" class="sentence">51  because both of you were unfaithful to me among the Israelites at the waters of Merʹi·bah of Kaʹdesh in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not sanctify me before the people of Israel.</span>
<span id="p950" class="sentence">52  You will see the land from a distance, but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.”</span></p></level1>
