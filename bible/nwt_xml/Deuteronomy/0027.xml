<p><span id="p721" class="sentence">Then Moses together with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying: “Observe every commandment that I am giving you today.</span>
<span id="p722" class="sentence">2  And in the day when you will cross the Jordan into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, set up large stones and cover them with plaster.</span>
<span id="p723" class="sentence">3  Then write on them all the words of this Law when you have crossed over, so that you may enter into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, has promised you.</span>
<span id="p724" class="sentence">4  When you have crossed the Jordan, you should set up these stones on Mount Eʹbal and cover them with plaster, just as I am commanding you today.</span>
<span id="p725" class="sentence">5  You are also to build an altar there to Jehovah your God, an altar of stones. You should not use iron tools on them.</span>
<span id="p726" class="sentence">6  You should build the altar of Jehovah your God with whole stones and offer burnt offerings to Jehovah your God on it.</span>
<span id="p727" class="sentence">7  You are to offer communion sacrifices and eat them there, and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God.</span>
<span id="p728" class="sentence">8  And clearly write on the stones all the words of this Law.”</span>
<span id="p729" class="sentence">9  Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying: “Keep silent and listen, O Israel. This day you have become the people of Jehovah your God.</span>
<span id="p730" class="sentence">10  You must listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and carry out his commandments and his regulations, which I am commanding you today.”</span>
<span id="p731" class="sentence">11  On that day Moses commanded the people, saying:</span>
<span id="p732" class="sentence">12  “The following tribes will stand on Mount Gerʹi·zim to bless the people when you have crossed the Jordan: Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, Joseph, and Benjamin.</span>
<span id="p733" class="sentence">13  And the following will stand on Mount Eʹbal to pronounce the curse: Reuʹben, Gad, Ashʹer, Zebʹu·lun, Dan, and Naphʹta·li.</span>
<span id="p734" class="sentence">14  And the Levites will answer every man of Israel with a loud voice:</span>
<span id="p735" class="sentence">15  “‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved image or a metal statue, a thing detestable to Jehovah, the workmanship of the hands of a craftsman, and who has hidden it.’ (And all the people will respond, saying, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p736" class="sentence">16  “‘Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p737" class="sentence">17  “‘Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor’s boundary marker.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p738" class="sentence">18  “‘Cursed is the one who causes a blind person to lose his way on the road.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p739" class="sentence">19  “‘Cursed is the one who perverts the judgment of a foreign resident, a fatherless child, or a widow.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p740" class="sentence">20  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his father’s wife, for he has dishonored his father.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p741" class="sentence">21  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with any animal.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p742" class="sentence">22  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p743" class="sentence">23  “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his mother-in-law.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p744" class="sentence">24  “‘Cursed is the one who ambushes and kills his neighbor.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p745" class="sentence">25  “‘Cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span>
<span id="p746" class="sentence">26  “‘Cursed is the one who will not uphold the words of this Law by carrying them out.’ (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’)</span></p></level1>
