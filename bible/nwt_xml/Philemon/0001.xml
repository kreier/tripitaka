<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Phi·leʹmon our beloved fellow worker,</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  and to Apʹphi·a our sister, and to Ar·chipʹpus our fellow soldier, and to the congregation that is in your house:</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  as I keep hearing of your faith and the love that you have for the Lord Jesus and for all the holy ones.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  I pray that your sharing in the faith may move you to acknowledge every good thing that we have through Christ.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  For I received much joy and comfort on hearing of your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  For this very reason, though I have great freeness of speech in connection with Christ to order you to do what is proper,</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love, seeing that I am Paul an older man, yes, now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  I am appealing to you for my child, whose father I became while in prison, O·nesʹi·mus.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  He was formerly useless to you, but now he is useful to you and to me.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  I am sending him back to you, yes him, my very own heart.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  I would like to keep him here for myself so that he might take your place in ministering to me during my imprisonment for the sake of the good news.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  But I do not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed may be done, not under compulsion, but of your own free will.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  Perhaps this is really why he broke away for a short while, so that you may have him back forever,</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  no longer as a slave, but as more than a slave, as a brother who is beloved, especially so to me, but how much more so to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  So if you consider me a friend, receive him kindly the same way you would me.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  Moreover, if he did you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to my account.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  I, Paul, am writing with my own hand: I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me even your own self.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  Yes, brother, may I receive this assistance from you in connection with the Lord; refresh my heart in connection with Christ.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  I am confident that you will comply, so I am writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say.</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">22  But along with that, also prepare a place for me to stay, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given back to you.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">23  Sending you greetings is Epʹa·phras, my fellow captive in union with Christ Jesus,</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">24  also Mark, Ar·is·tarʹchus, Deʹmas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">25  The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show.</span></p></level1>
