<level1><h1 id="p92">Chapter 7</h1>
<p><span id="p93" class="sentence">Woe to me! I am like one who,After the gathering of summer fruitAnd the gleaning following a grape harvest,Finds no cluster of grapes to eat,No early fig that I crave.</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">2  The loyal one has perished from the earth;Among men there is no one upright.
All of them lie in ambush for bloodshed.
Each hunts his own brother with a dragnet.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">3  Their hands are expert at doing what is bad;The prince is making demands,The judge asks for a reward,The prominent one makes known his desires,And they work it out together.</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">4  Their best one is like thorns,Their most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge.
The day of your watchmen and of your reckoning will come.
Now they will panic.</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">5  Do not put faith in your companionOr trust a close friend.
Guard what you say to the one who lies in your embrace.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">6  For a son despises his father,A daughter rises up against her mother,And a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law;A man’s enemies are the men of his household.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">7  But as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.
I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation.
My God will hear me.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">8  Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy.
Although I have fallen, I will rise up;Although I dwell in the darkness, Jehovah will be my light.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">9  The wrath of Jehovah I will bear—For I have sinned against him—Until he pleads my legal case and brings about justice for me.
He will bring me out to the light;I will look upon his righteousness.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">10  My enemy will also see,And shame will cover her who said to me:
“Where is Jehovah your God?”
My eyes will look upon her.
Now she will be trampled like mud in the streets.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">11  It will be a day for building your stone walls;On that day the boundary will be extended.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">12  On that day they will come to youAll the way from As·syrʹi·a and the cities of Egypt,From Egypt all the way to the River;From sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">13  And the land will become desolate because of its inhabitants,As a result of what they have done.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">14  Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance,The one who was living alone in a forest—in the midst of an orchard.
Let them feed on Baʹshan and Gilʹe·ad as in the days of old.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">15  “As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,I will show him wonderful things.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">16  Nations will see and be ashamed despite all their might.
They will put their hand over their mouth;Their ears will become deaf.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">17  They will lick the dust like serpents;Like the reptiles of the earth they will come trembling out of their strongholds.
To Jehovah our God they will come in dread,And they will be in fear of you.”</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">18  Who is a God like you,Pardoning error and passing over the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?
He will not hold onto his anger forever,For he delights in loyal love.</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">19  He will again show us mercy; he will conquer our errors.
You will throw all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">20  You will show faithfulness to Jacob,Loyal love to Abraham,As you swore to our forefathers from the days of old.</span></p></level1>
