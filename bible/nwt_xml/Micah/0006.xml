<p><span id="p76" class="sentence">Hear, please, what Jehovah is saying.
Get up, present a legal case before the mountains,And may the hills hear your voice.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">2  Hear, O mountains, the legal case of Jehovah,You firm foundations of the earth,For Jehovah has a legal case with his people;It is against Israel that he will argue:</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">3  “My people, what have I done to you?
How have I tired you out?
Testify against me.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">4  For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,From the house of slavery I redeemed you;I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Mirʹi·am.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">5  My people, remember, please, what King Baʹlak of Moʹab proposed,And what Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor answered him—What took place from Shitʹtim to Gilʹgal—So that you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">6  With what will I come before Jehovah?
With what will I bow before God on high?
Will I come before him with whole burnt offerings,With year-old calves?</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">7  Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams,With tens of thousands of torrents of oil?
Will I give my firstborn son for my revolt,The fruit of my body for my sin?</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">8  He has told you, O man, what is good.
And what is Jehovah requiring of you?
Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty,And to walk in modesty with your God!</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">9  The voice of Jehovah calls out to the city;Those with practical wisdom will fear your name.
Pay attention to the rod and to the one who appointed it.</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">10  Are there still the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wickedAnd the incomplete eʹphah measure that is detestable?</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">11  Can I be morally clean with wicked scales,With a bag of fraudulent stone weights?</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">12  For her rich men are full of violence,And her inhabitants speak lies;Their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">13  “Therefore, I will wound you by striking you,Making you desolate because of your sins.</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">14  You will eat but not be satisfied;You will be empty inside.
What you remove, you will not carry off safely,And what you do carry off, I will give to the sword.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">15  You will sow seed, but you will not reap.
You will tread olives, but you will not use the oil;And you will make new wine, but you will drink no wine.</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">16  For you observe the statutes of Omʹri and all the work of the house of Aʹhab,And you walk in accord with their advice.
That is why I will make you an object of horrorAnd her inhabitants something to be whistled at;And you will bear the scorn of the peoples.”</span></p></level1>
