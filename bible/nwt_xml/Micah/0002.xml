<level1><h1 id="p18">Chapter 2</h1>
<p><span id="p19" class="sentence">“Woe to those who scheme what is harmful,Who work out evil on their beds!
When morning light comes they carry it out,Because it is in the power of their hand.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">2  They desire fields and seize them;Also houses, and they take them;They defraud a man of his house,A man of his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">3  Therefore this is what Jehovah says:
‘Here I am devising against this family a calamity from which you will not escape.
You will no longer walk haughtily, for it is a time of calamity.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">4  In that day people will recite a proverb concerning you,And they will bitterly lament over you.
They will say: “We are completely devastated!
He caused the portion of my people to change hands—how he removes it from me!
To the unfaithful one he assigns our fields.”</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">5  So you will have no one to stretch the measuring cord,To allot the land in the congregation of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">6  “Stop preaching!” they preach,“They should not preach these things;Humiliation will not overtake us!”</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">7  Is it being said, O house of Jacob:
“Has the spirit of Jehovah become impatient?
Are these his deeds?”
Do not my own words bring good to those walking uprightly?</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">8  But lately my own people have risen up as an enemy.
You openly strip off the majestic ornament with the garmentFrom those passing by confidently, like those returning from war.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">9  You drive the women of my people out from their delightful houses;From their children you take away my splendor forever.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">10  Get up and go, for this is no place of rest.
Because of uncleanness, there is destruction, grievous destruction.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">11  If a man walks after wind and deception and tells this lie:
“I will preach to you about wine and alcoholic drink,”
Then he would be just the preacher for this people!</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">12  I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob;I will surely collect the remaining ones of Israel together.
In unity I will place them, like sheep in the pen,Like a flock in its pasture;It will be noisy with people.’</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">13  The one breaking out will go before them;They will break out and pass through the gate and go out by it.
Their king will pass through before them,With Jehovah at their head.”</span></p></level1>
