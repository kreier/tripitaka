<p><span id="p167" class="sentence">When Hiʹram the king of Tyre heard that Solʹo·mon had been anointed as king in place of his father, he sent his servants to Solʹo·mon, for Hiʹram had always been a friend of David’s.</span>
<span id="p168" class="sentence">2  In turn Solʹo·mon sent word to Hiʹram:</span>
<span id="p169" class="sentence">3  “You well know that David my father was not able to build a house for the name of Jehovah his God because of the wars waged against him from every side until Jehovah put his enemies under the soles of his feet.</span>
<span id="p170" class="sentence">4  But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on all sides. There is no one opposing me and nothing bad happening.</span>
<span id="p171" class="sentence">5  So I intend to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, just as Jehovah promised to David my father, saying: ‘Your son whom I will put on your throne in your place, he is the one who will build the house for my name.’</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">6  Now command your people to cut cedars of Lebʹa·non for me. My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set, for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the Si·doʹni·ans.”</span>
<span id="p173" class="sentence">7  When Hiʹram heard Solʹo·mon’s words, he rejoiced greatly and said: “May Jehovah be praised today, for he has given David a wise son over this great people!”</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">8  So Hiʹram sent word to Solʹo·mon: “I have heard the message you sent to me. I will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers.</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">9  My servants will bring them down from Lebʹa·non to the sea, and I will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me. I will have them broken up there, and you can carry them away. In exchange, you will provide the food that I request for my household.”</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">10  So Hiʹram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that Solʹo·mon desired.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">11  And Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram 20,000 cor measures of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil. That was what Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram year after year.</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">12  And Jehovah gave Solʹo·mon wisdom, just as He had promised him. And there was peace between Hiʹram and Solʹo·mon, and the two of them made a treaty.</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">13  King Solʹo·mon conscripted men for forced labor out of all Israel; 30,000 men were conscripted.</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">14  He would send them to Lebʹa·non in shifts of 10,000 each month. They would spend a month in Lebʹa·non and two months at their homes; and Ad·o·niʹram was over those conscripted for forced labor.</span>
<span id="p181" class="sentence">15  Solʹo·mon had 70,000 common laborers and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains,</span>
<span id="p182" class="sentence">16  as well as Solʹo·mon’s 3,300 princely deputies who served as foremen to supervise the workmen.</span>
<span id="p183" class="sentence">17  At the king’s order, they quarried large stones, expensive stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones.</span>
<span id="p184" class="sentence">18  So Solʹo·mon’s builders and Hiʹram’s builders and the Geʹbal·ites did the cutting, and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.</span></p></level1>
