<span id="p162" class="sentence">31  He was wiser than any other man, wiser than Eʹthan the Ezʹra·hite and Heʹman, Calʹcol, and Darʹda, the sons of Maʹhol; his fame spread among all the surrounding nations.</span>
<span id="p163" class="sentence">32  He composed 3,000 proverbs and his songs numbered 1,005.</span>
<span id="p164" class="sentence">33  He would speak about the trees, from the cedar in Lebʹa·non to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he would speak about the animals, the birds, the creeping things, and the fish.</span>
<span id="p165" class="sentence">34  People from all the nations came to hear Solʹo·mon’s wisdom, including kings from all over the earth who had heard about his wisdom.</span></p></level1>
