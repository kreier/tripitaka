<p><span id="p19" class="sentence">You, however, keep on speaking what is consistent with wholesome teaching.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">2  Let the older men be moderate in habits, serious, sound in mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">3  Likewise, let the older women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good,</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">4  so that they may advise the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">5  to be sound in mind, chaste, working at home, good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">6  Likewise, keep on urging the younger men to be sound in mind,</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">7  showing yourself to be an example of fine works in every way. Teach what is pure with all seriousness,</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">8  using wholesome speech that cannot be criticized, so that those who oppose may be put to shame, having nothing negative to say about us.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">9  Let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things, trying to please them, not talking back,</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">10  not stealing from them, but showing complete trustworthiness, so that in every way they may adorn the teaching of our Savior, God.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">11  For the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">12  It trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things,</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">13  while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of our Savior, Jesus Christ,</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">14  who gave himself for us to set us free from every sort of lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people who are his own special possession, zealous for fine works.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">15  Keep on speaking these things and exhorting and reproving with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you.</span></p></level1>
