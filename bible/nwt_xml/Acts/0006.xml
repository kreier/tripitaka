<p><span id="p185" class="sentence">Now in those days when the disciples were increasing, the Greek-speaking Jews began complaining against the Hebrew-speaking Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.</span>
<span id="p186" class="sentence">2  So the Twelve called the multitude of the disciples together and said: “It is not right for us to leave the word of God to distribute food to tables.</span>
<span id="p187" class="sentence">3  So, brothers, select for yourselves seven reputable men from among you, full of spirit and wisdom, that we may appoint them over this necessary matter;</span>
<span id="p188" class="sentence">4  but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</span>
<span id="p189" class="sentence">5  What they said was pleasing to the whole multitude, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and holy spirit, as well as Philip, Prochʹo·rus, Ni·caʹnor, Tiʹmon, Parʹme·nas, and Nic·o·laʹus, a proselyte of Antioch.</span>
<span id="p190" class="sentence">6  They brought them to the apostles, and after praying, they laid their hands on them.</span>
<span id="p191" class="sentence">7  Consequently, the word of God continued to spread, and the number of the disciples kept multiplying very much in Jerusalem; and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.</span>
<span id="p192" class="sentence">8  Now Stephen, full of divine favor and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</span>
<span id="p193" class="sentence">9  But some men of the so-called Synagogue of the Freedmen came forward, along with some Cy·reʹni·ans and Alexandrians, and some from Ci·liʹcia and Asia, to dispute with Stephen.</span>
<span id="p194" class="sentence">10  But they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking.</span>
<span id="p195" class="sentence">11  Then they secretly persuaded men to say: “We have heard him speaking blasphemous things against Moses and God.”</span>
<span id="p196" class="sentence">12  And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and coming upon him suddenly, they forcibly seized him and led him to the Sanʹhe·drin.</span>
<span id="p197" class="sentence">13  And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: “This man does not stop speaking things against this holy place and against the Law.</span>
<span id="p198" class="sentence">14  For instance, we have heard him say that this Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ will throw down this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”</span>
<span id="p199" class="sentence">15  And as all those sitting in the Sanʹhe·drin stared at him, they saw that his face was like an angel’s face.</span></p></level1>
