<level1><h1 id="p395">Chapter 11</h1>
<p><span id="p396" class="sentence">Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Ju·deʹa heard that people of the nations had also accepted the word of God.</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">2  So when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the supporters of circumcision began to criticize him,</span>
<span id="p398" class="sentence">3  saying: “You went into the house of men who were not circumcised and ate with them.”</span>
<span id="p399" class="sentence">4  At this Peter went on to explain the matter in detail to them, saying:</span>
<span id="p400" class="sentence">5  “I was in the city of Jopʹpa praying, and while in a trance I saw a vision, something descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners from heaven, and it came right down to me.</span>
<span id="p401" class="sentence">6  Looking closely into it, I observed four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of heaven.</span>
<span id="p402" class="sentence">7  I also heard a voice say to me: ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’</span>
<span id="p403" class="sentence">8  But I said: ‘Certainly not, Lord, because a defiled or unclean thing has never entered my mouth.’</span>
<span id="p404" class="sentence">9  The second time, the voice from heaven answered: ‘You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.’</span>
<span id="p405" class="sentence">10  This happened a third time, and everything was pulled up again into heaven.</span>
<span id="p406" class="sentence">11  Also just at that moment, three men were standing at the house where we were staying, having been sent to me from Caes·a·reʹa.</span>
<span id="p407" class="sentence">12  Then the spirit told me to go with them, not doubting at all. But these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.</span>
<span id="p408" class="sentence">13  “He reported to us how he saw the angel stand in his house and say: ‘Send men to Jopʹpa and summon Simon who is called Peter,</span>
<span id="p409" class="sentence">14  and he will tell you things by which you and all your household may get saved.’</span>
<span id="p410" class="sentence">15  But when I started to speak, the holy spirit fell on them just as it did also on us in the beginning.</span>
<span id="p411" class="sentence">16  At this I recalled the saying of the Lord, how he used to say: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with holy spirit.’</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">17  If, therefore, God gave the same free gift to them that he gave to us who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should be able to hinder God?”</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">18  When they heard these things, they stopped objecting, and they glorified God, saying: “So, then, God has also granted to people of the nations repentance leading to life.”</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">19  Now those who had been scattered by the tribulation that arose over Stephen went as far as Phoe·niʹcia, Cyʹprus, and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews.</span>
<span id="p415" class="sentence">20  However, some of the men among them from Cyʹprus and Cy·reʹne came to Antioch and began talking to the Greek-speaking people, declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span id="p416" class="sentence">21  Furthermore, the hand of Jehovah was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.</span>
<span id="p417" class="sentence">22  The report about them reached the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barʹna·bas as far as Antioch.</span>
<span id="p418" class="sentence">23  When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with heartfelt resolve;</span>
<span id="p419" class="sentence">24  for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.</span>
<span id="p420" class="sentence">25  So he went to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul.</span>
<span id="p421" class="sentence">26  After he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year they assembled with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.</span>
<span id="p422" class="sentence">27  In those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span>
<span id="p423" class="sentence">28  One of them named Agʹa·bus stood up and foretold through the spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire inhabited earth, which, in fact, did take place in the time of Claudius.</span>
<span id="p424" class="sentence">29  So the disciples determined, each according to what he could afford, to send relief to the brothers living in Ju·deʹa;</span>
<span id="p425" class="sentence">30  and this they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barʹna·bas and Saul.</span></p></level1>
