<p><span id="p871" class="sentence">Five days later the high priest An·a·niʹas came down with some elders and a public speaker named Ter·tulʹlus, and they presented their case against Paul to the governor.</span>
<span id="p872" class="sentence">2  When he was called, Ter·tulʹlus started accusing him, saying:
“Seeing that we enjoy great peace through you and that through your forethought reforms are taking place in this nation,</span>
<span id="p873" class="sentence">3  at all times and also in all places we acknowledge this, Your Excellency Felix, with the greatest thankfulness.</span>
<span id="p874" class="sentence">4  But that I may not detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly in your kindness.</span>
<span id="p875" class="sentence">5  For we have found this man to be a pest, stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and he is a spearhead of the sect of the Naz·a·renesʹ.</span>
<span id="p876" class="sentence">6  He also tried to profane the temple, so we seized him.</span>
<span id="p877" class="sentence">7  ——</span>
<span id="p878" class="sentence">8  When you examine him yourself, you will find out about all these things of which we are accusing him.”</span>
<span id="p879" class="sentence">9  With that the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were true.</span>
<span id="p880" class="sentence">10  When the governor nodded to Paul to speak, he answered:
“Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for many years, I readily speak in my own defense.</span>
<span id="p881" class="sentence">11  As you can verify for yourself, it has not been more than 12 days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem;</span>
<span id="p882" class="sentence">12  and they found me neither arguing with anyone in the temple nor stirring up a mob, either in the synagogues or throughout the city.</span>
<span id="p883" class="sentence">13  Nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of right now.</span>
<span id="p884" class="sentence">14  But I do admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers, as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets.</span>
<span id="p885" class="sentence">15  And I have hope toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.</span>
<span id="p886" class="sentence">16  Because of this I always strive to maintain a clear conscience before God and men.</span>
<span id="p887" class="sentence">17  Now after quite a number of years, I arrived to bring gifts of mercy to my nation and to make offerings.</span>
<span id="p888" class="sentence">18  While I was caring for these matters, they found me ceremonially cleansed in the temple, but not with a crowd or causing a disturbance. But there were some Jews from the province of Asia</span>
<span id="p889" class="sentence">19  who ought to be present before you to accuse me if they actually have anything against me.</span>
<span id="p890" class="sentence">20  Or let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanʹhe·drin,</span>
<span id="p891" class="sentence">21  except for this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: ‘Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before you!’”</span>
<span id="p892" class="sentence">22  However, Felix, knowing quite well the facts concerning this Way, began to put them off and say: “Whenever Lysʹi·as the military commander comes down, I will decide these matters involving you.”</span>
<span id="p893" class="sentence">23  And he gave orders to the army officer that the man be kept under arrest but given some freedom, and that his people be allowed to attend to his needs.</span>
<span id="p894" class="sentence">24  Some days later Felix came with Dru·silʹla his wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about the belief in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span id="p895" class="sentence">25  But as Paul talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and answered: “Go away for now, but when I have an opportunity I will send for you again.”</span>
<span id="p896" class="sentence">26  At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him money. For that reason, he sent for him even more frequently and conversed with him.</span>
<span id="p897" class="sentence">27  But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor with the Jews, he left Paul in custody.</span></p></level1>
