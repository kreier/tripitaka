<level1><h1 id="p283">Chapter 12</h1>
<p><span id="p284" class="sentence">Now concerning the spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.</span>
<span id="p285" class="sentence">2  You know that when you were people of the nations, you were influenced and led astray to those voiceless idols, following wherever they might lead you.</span>
<span id="p286" class="sentence">3  Now I would have you know that nobody when speaking by God’s spirit says: “Jesus is accursed!” and nobody can say: “Jesus is Lord!” except by holy spirit.</span>
<span id="p287" class="sentence">4  Now there are different gifts, but there is the same spirit;</span>
<span id="p288" class="sentence">5  and there are different ministries, and yet there is the same Lord;</span>
<span id="p289" class="sentence">6  and there are different activities, and yet it is the same God who performs them all in everyone.</span>
<span id="p290" class="sentence">7  But the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose.</span>
<span id="p291" class="sentence">8  For to one is given speech of wisdom through the spirit, to another speech of knowledge according to the same spirit,</span>
<span id="p292" class="sentence">9  to another faith by the same spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one spirit,</span>
<span id="p293" class="sentence">10  to yet another operations of powerful works, to another prophesying, to another discernment of inspired expressions, to another different tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.</span>
<span id="p294" class="sentence">11  But all these operations are performed by the very same spirit, distributing to each one respectively just as it wills.</span>
<span id="p295" class="sentence">12  For just as the body is one but has many members, and all the members of that body, although many, are one body, so too is the Christ.</span>
<span id="p296" class="sentence">13  For by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink one spirit.</span>
<span id="p297" class="sentence">14  For, indeed, the body is made up not of one member but of many.</span>
<span id="p298" class="sentence">15  If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am no part of the body,” that does not make it no part of the body.</span>
<span id="p299" class="sentence">16  And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am no part of the body,” that does not make it no part of the body.</span>
<span id="p300" class="sentence">17  If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?</span>
<span id="p301" class="sentence">18  But now God has arranged each of the body members just as he pleased.</span>
<span id="p302" class="sentence">19  If they were all the same member, where would the body be?</span>
<span id="p303" class="sentence">20  But now they are many members, yet one body.</span>
<span id="p304" class="sentence">21  The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you,” or again, the head cannot say to the feet, “I do not need you.”</span>
<span id="p305" class="sentence">22  On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary,</span>
<span id="p306" class="sentence">23  and the parts of the body that we think to be less honorable we surround with greater honor, so our unseemly parts are treated with greater modesty,</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">24  whereas our attractive parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that had a lack,</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">25  so that there should be no division in the body, but its members should have mutual concern for one another.</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">26  If one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it; or if a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it.</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">27  Now you are Christ’s body, and each of you individually is a member.</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">28  And God has assigned the respective ones in the congregation: first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then powerful works; then gifts of healings; helpful services; abilities to direct; different tongues.</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">29  Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform powerful works, do they?</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">30  Not all have gifts of healings, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all are interpreters, are they?</span>
<span id="p314" class="sentence">31  But keep striving for the greater gifts. And yet I will show you a surpassing way.</span></p></level1>
