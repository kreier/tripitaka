<level1><h1 id="p172">Chapter 8</h1>
<p><span id="p173" class="sentence">Now concerning food offered to idols: We know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">2  If anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know it as he should know it.</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">3  But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">4  Now concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">5  For even though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods” and many “lords,”</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">6  there is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and we through him.</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">7  However, not all have this knowledge. But some, because of their former association with the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">8  But food will not bring us nearer to God; we are no worse off if we do not eat, nor better off if we eat.</span>
<span id="p181" class="sentence">9  But keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</span>
<span id="p182" class="sentence">10  For if anyone should see you who have knowledge having a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be emboldened to the point of eating food offered to idols?</span>
<span id="p183" class="sentence">11  So by your knowledge the man who is weak is being ruined, your brother for whose sake Christ died.</span>
<span id="p184" class="sentence">12  When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.</span>
<span id="p185" class="sentence">13  That is why if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat at all, so that I will not make my brother stumble.</span></p></level1>
