<p><span id="p316" class="sentence">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a clanging gong or a clashing cymbal.</span>
<span id="p317" class="sentence">2  And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</span>
<span id="p318" class="sentence">3  And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I do not benefit at all.</span>
<span id="p319" class="sentence">4  Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, does not get puffed up,</span>
<span id="p320" class="sentence">5  does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.</span>
<span id="p321" class="sentence">6  It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.</span>
<span id="p322" class="sentence">7  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</span>
<span id="p323" class="sentence">8  Love never fails. But if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away with; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away with.</span>
<span id="p324" class="sentence">9  For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially,</span>
<span id="p325" class="sentence">10  but when what is complete comes, what is partial will be done away with.</span>
<span id="p326" class="sentence">11  When I was a child, I used to speak as a child, to think as a child, to reason as a child; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a child.</span>
<span id="p327" class="sentence">12  For now we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face-to-face. At present I know partially, but then I will know accurately, just as I am accurately known.</span>
<span id="p328" class="sentence">13  Now, however, these three remain: faith, hope, love; but the greatest of these is love.</span></p></level1>
