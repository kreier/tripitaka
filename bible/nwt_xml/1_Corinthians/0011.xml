<p><span id="p249" class="sentence">Become imitators of me, just as I am of Christ.</span>
<span id="p250" class="sentence">2  I commend you because in all things you remember me and you are holding fast the traditions just as I handed them on to you.</span>
<span id="p251" class="sentence">3  But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God.</span>
<span id="p252" class="sentence">4  Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head shames his head;</span>
<span id="p253" class="sentence">5  but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a woman with a shaved head.</span>
<span id="p254" class="sentence">6  For if a woman does not cover herself, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, she should be covered.</span>
<span id="p255" class="sentence">7  For a man should not have his head covered, as he is God’s image and glory, but the woman is man’s glory.</span>
<span id="p256" class="sentence">8  For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man.</span>
<span id="p257" class="sentence">9  And what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</span>
<span id="p258" class="sentence">10  That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.</span>
<span id="p259" class="sentence">11  Besides, in connection with the Lord, neither is woman separate from man nor is man separate from woman.</span>
<span id="p260" class="sentence">12  For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman; but all things are from God.</span>
<span id="p261" class="sentence">13  Judge for yourselves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</span>
<span id="p262" class="sentence">14  Does not nature itself teach you that long hair is a dishonor to a man,</span>
<span id="p263" class="sentence">15  but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her instead of a covering.</span>
<span id="p264" class="sentence">16  However, if anyone wants to argue in favor of some other custom, we have no other, nor do the congregations of God.</span>
<span id="p265" class="sentence">17  But while giving these instructions, I do not commend you, because it is, not for the better, but for the worse that you meet together.</span>
<span id="p266" class="sentence">18  For first of all, I hear that when you come together in a congregation, divisions exist among you; and to an extent I believe it.</span>
<span id="p267" class="sentence">19  For there will certainly also be sects among you, so that those of you who are approved may also become evident.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">20  When you come together in one place, it is not really to eat the Lord’s Evening Meal.</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">21  For when you eat it, each one takes his own evening meal beforehand, so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated.</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">22  Do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the congregation of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed? What can I say to you? Should I commend you? In this I do not commend you.</span>
<span id="p271" class="sentence">23  For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night on which he was going to be betrayed took a loaf,</span>
<span id="p272" class="sentence">24  and after giving thanks, he broke it and said: “This means my body, which is in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”</span>
<span id="p273" class="sentence">25  He did the same with the cup also, after they had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood. Keep doing this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span>
<span id="p274" class="sentence">26  For whenever you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he comes.</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">27  Therefore, whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord.</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">28  First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, and only then let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">29  For the one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment against himself.</span>
<span id="p278" class="sentence">30  That is why many among you are weak and sick, and quite a few are sleeping in death.</span>
<span id="p279" class="sentence">31  But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged.</span>
<span id="p280" class="sentence">32  However, when we are judged, we are disciplined by Jehovah, so that we may not become condemned with the world.</span>
<span id="p281" class="sentence">33  Consequently, my brothers, when you come together to eat it, wait for one another.</span>
<span id="p282" class="sentence">34  If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come together it is not for judgment. But as for the remaining matters, I will put them in order when I get there.</span></p></level1>
