<p><span id="p97" class="sentence">Actually sexual immorality is reported among you, and such immorality as is not even found among the nations—of a man living with his father’s wife.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">2  And are you proud of it? Should you not rather mourn, so that the man who committed this deed should be taken away from your midst?</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">3  Although absent in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already judged the man who has done this, as if I were actually with you.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">4  When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and knowing that I am with you in spirit along with the power of our Lord Jesus,</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">5  you must hand such a man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">6  Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough?</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">7  Clear away the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, inasmuch as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">8  So, then, let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">9  In my letter I wrote you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people,</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">10  not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, you would actually have to get out of the world.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">11  But now I am writing you to stop keeping company with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">12  For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do you not judge those inside,</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">13  while God judges those outside? “Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.”</span></p></level1>
