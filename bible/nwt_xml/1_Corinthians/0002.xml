<p><span id="p34" class="sentence">So when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with extravagant speech or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to you.</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">2  For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and him executed on the stake.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">3  And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling;</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">4  and my speech and what I preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of spirit and power,</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">5  so that your faith might be, not in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">6  Now we speak wisdom among those who are mature, but not the wisdom of this system of things nor that of the rulers of this system of things, who are to come to nothing.</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">7  But we speak God’s wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things for our glory.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">8  It is this wisdom that none of the rulers of this system of things came to know, for if they had known it, they would not have executed the glorious Lord.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">9  But just as it is written: “Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, nor have there been conceived in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those who love him.”</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">10  For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">11  For who among men knows the things of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So, too, no one has come to know the things of God except the spirit of God.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">12  Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit that is from God, so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">13  These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, as we explain spiritual matters with spiritual words.</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">14  But a physical man does not accept the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know them, because they are examined spiritually.</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">15  However, the spiritual man examines all things, but he himself is not examined by any man.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">16  For “who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, so that he may instruct him?” But we do have the mind of Christ.</span></p></level1>
