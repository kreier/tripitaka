<p><span id="p430" class="sentence">Now concerning the collection for the holy ones, you may follow the directions I gave to the congregations of Ga·laʹti·a.</span>
<span id="p431" class="sentence">2  On the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside according to his own means, so that collections will not take place when I arrive.</span>
<span id="p432" class="sentence">3  But when I get there, I will send the men you approve of in your letters to take your kind gift to Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p433" class="sentence">4  However, if it seems advisable for me to go there also, they will go there with me.</span>
<span id="p434" class="sentence">5  But I will come to you when I have gone through Mac·e·doʹni·a, for I will be going through Mac·e·doʹni·a;</span>
<span id="p435" class="sentence">6  and perhaps I will stay or even spend the winter with you, so that you may accompany me partway to where I may be going.</span>
<span id="p436" class="sentence">7  For I do not want to see you now just in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if Jehovah permits.</span>
<span id="p437" class="sentence">8  But I am remaining in Ephʹe·sus until the Festival of Pentecost,</span>
<span id="p438" class="sentence">9  because a large door that leads to activity has been opened to me, but there are many opposers.</span>
<span id="p439" class="sentence">10  Now if Timothy arrives, make sure that he has nothing to fear while among you, for he is performing the work of Jehovah, just as I am.</span>
<span id="p440" class="sentence">11  Therefore, let no one look down on him. Send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am waiting for him together with the brothers.</span>
<span id="p441" class="sentence">12  Now concerning A·polʹlos our brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers. It was not his intention to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.</span>
<span id="p442" class="sentence">13  Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on in a manly way, grow mighty.</span>
<span id="p443" class="sentence">14  Let everything you do be done with love.</span>
<span id="p444" class="sentence">15  Now I urge you, brothers: You know that the household of Stephʹa·nas is the firstfruits of A·chaʹia and that they devoted themselves to ministering to the holy ones.</span>
<span id="p445" class="sentence">16  May you also keep submitting yourselves to people like that and to all those cooperating and working hard.</span>
<span id="p446" class="sentence">17  But I rejoice over the presence of Stephʹa·nas and For·tu·naʹtus and A·chaʹi·cus, because they have made up for your not being here.</span>
<span id="p447" class="sentence">18  For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, give recognition to men of that sort.</span>
<span id="p448" class="sentence">19  The congregations of Asia send you their greetings. Aqʹui·la and Prisʹca together with the congregation that is in their house greet you heartily in the Lord.</span>
<span id="p449" class="sentence">20  All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span>
<span id="p450" class="sentence">21  Here is my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand.</span>
<span id="p451" class="sentence">22  If anyone has no affection for the Lord, let him be accursed. O our Lord, come!</span>
<span id="p452" class="sentence">23  May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with you.</span>
<span id="p453" class="sentence">24  May my love be with all of you in union with Christ Jesus.</span></p></level1>
