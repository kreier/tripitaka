<level1><h1 id="p50">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p51" class="sentence">So, brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshly men, as to infants in Christ.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">2  I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet strong enough. In fact, neither are you strong enough now,</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">3  for you are still fleshly. Since there are jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and are you not walking as men do?</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">4  For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” but another says, “I to A·polʹlos,” are you not acting like mere men?</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">5  What, then, is A·polʹlos? Yes, what is Paul? Ministers through whom you became believers, just as the Lord granted each one.</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">6  I planted, A·polʹlos watered, but God kept making it grow,</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">7  so that neither is the one who plants anything nor is the one who waters, but God who makes it grow.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">8  Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each person will receive his own reward according to his own work.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">9  For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field under cultivation, God’s building.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">10  According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me, I laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, but someone else is building on it. But let each one keep watching how he is building on it.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">11  For no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">12  Now if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">13  each one’s work will be shown for what it is, for the day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire, and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one has built.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">14  If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward;</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">15  if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved; yet, if so, it will be as through fire.</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">16  Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that the spirit of God dwells in you?</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">17  If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">18  Let no one deceive himself: If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this system of things, let him become a fool, so that he may become wise.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">19  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written: “He catches the wise in their own cunning.”</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">20  And again: “Jehovah knows that the reasonings of the wise men are futile.”</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">21  So let no one boast in men; for all things belong to you,</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">22  whether Paul or A·polʹlos or Ceʹphas or the world or life or death or things now here or things to come, all things belong to you;</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">23  in turn you belong to Christ; Christ, in turn, belongs to God.</span></p></level1>
