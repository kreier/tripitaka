<p><span id="p265" class="sentence">And I saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues. These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish.</span>
<span id="p266" class="sentence">2  And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who are victorious over the wild beast and its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of God.</span>
<span id="p267" class="sentence">3  They were singing the song of Moses the slave of God and the song of the Lamb, saying:
“Great and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">4  Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been revealed.”</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">5  After this I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness was opened in heaven,</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">6  and the seven angels with the seven plagues emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests.</span>
<span id="p271" class="sentence">7  One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever.</span>
<span id="p272" class="sentence">8  And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.</span></p></level1>
