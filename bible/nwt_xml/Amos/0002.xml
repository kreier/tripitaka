<p><span id="p18" class="sentence">“This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts of Moʹab, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because he burned the bones of the king of Eʹdom for lime.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">2  So I will send a fire into Moʹab,And it will consume the fortified towers of Keʹri·oth;Moʹab will die amid an uproar,With a war cry, with the sound of a horn.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">3  I will remove the ruler from her midstAnd kill all her princes along with him,” says Jehovah.’</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">4  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Judah, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they rejected the law of Jehovah,And because they did not keep his regulations;But the same lies their forefathers followed have led them astray.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">5  So I will send a fire into Judah,And it will consume the fortified towers of Jerusalem.’</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">6  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Israel, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they sell the righteous for silver,And the poor for a pair of sandals.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">7  They trample the heads of the lowly into the dust of the earth,And they block the path of the meek.
A man and his father have relations with the same girl,Profaning my holy name.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">8  They stretch out next to every altar on garments they seized as security for a loan;And the wine they drink at the house of their gods was obtained from those they fined.’</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">9  ‘But it was I who annihilated the Amʹor·ite before them,Who was as tall as the cedars and as strong as the oaks;I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">10  I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,And I made you walk through the wilderness 40 years,To take possession of the land of the Amʹor·ite.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">11  I raised up some of your sons as prophetsAnd some of your young men as Nazʹi·rites.
Is this not so, O people of Israel?’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">12  ‘But you kept giving the Nazʹi·rites wine to drink,And you commanded the prophets: “You must not prophesy.”</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">13  So I will crush you in your place,Just as a wagon loaded with cut grain crushes what is under it.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">14  The swift one will have no place to flee,The strong one will not retain his power,And no warrior will escape with his life.</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">15  The bowman will not stand his ground,The swift of foot will not escape,And the horseman will not escape with his life.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">16  Even the most courageous among the warriorsWill flee naked in that day,’ declares Jehovah.”</span></p></level1>
