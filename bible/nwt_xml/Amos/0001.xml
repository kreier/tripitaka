<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">The words of Aʹmos, who was among the sheep raisers from Te·koʹa, which he received in vision concerning Israel in the days of King Uz·ziʹah of Judah and in the days of Jer·o·boʹam son of Joʹash, the king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  He said:
“Jehovah will roar out of Zion,And he will raise his voice out of Jerusalem.
The pastures of the shepherds will mourn,And the summit of Carʹmel will dry up.”</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  “This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts of Damascus, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they threshed Gilʹe·ad with iron threshing sledges.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazʹa·el,And it will consume the fortified towers of Ben-haʹdad.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  I will break the bars of Damascus;I will destroy the inhabitants from Bikʹath-aʹvenAnd the one ruling from Beth-eʹden;And the people of Syria will go as exiles to Kir,” says Jehovah.’</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts of Gazʹa, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they took a whole group of exiles to hand them over to Eʹdom.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  So I will send a fire onto the wall of Gazʹa,And it will consume her fortified towers.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  I will destroy the inhabitants from Ashʹdod,And the one ruling from Ashʹke·lon;I will turn my hand against Ekʹron,And the remaining Phi·lisʹtines will perish,” says the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Tyre, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they handed over a whole group of exiles to Eʹdom,And because they did not remember the covenant of brothers.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  So I will send a fire onto the wall of Tyre,And it will consume her fortified towers.’</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  This is what Jehovah says,‘For three revolts of Eʹdom, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because he pursued his own brother with the sword,And because he refused to show mercy;In his anger he keeps tearing them apart relentlessly,And he remains furious with them continually.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  So I will send a fire into Teʹman,And it will consume the fortified towers of Bozʹrah.’</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  This is what Jehovah says,‘“For three revolts of the Amʹmon·ites, and for four, I will not reverse it,Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilʹe·ad to widen out their own territory.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  So I will set fire to the wall of Rabʹbah,And it will consume her fortified towers,With a war cry in the day of battle,With a tempest in the day of storm wind.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  And their king will go into exile together with his princes,” says Jehovah.’</span></p></level1>
