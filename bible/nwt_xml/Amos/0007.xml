<p><span id="p108" class="sentence">This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! He formed a locust swarm when the late crop was beginning to come up. This was the later crop after the king’s hay had been cut.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">2  When the swarm finished eating up the vegetation of the land, I said: “O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, please forgive! How can Jacob survive? For he is weak!”</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">3  So Jehovah reconsidered this. “It will not happen,” Jehovah said.</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">4  This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah called for a punishment by fire. It consumed the vast deep waters, and it consumed a portion of the land.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">5  Then I said: “O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, please hold this back. How can Jacob survive? For he is weak!”</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">6  So Jehovah reconsidered this. “That too will not happen,” the Sovereign Lord Jehovah said.</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">7  This is what he showed me: Look! Jehovah was standing on a wall made with a plumb line, and there was a plumb line in his hand.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">8  Then Jehovah said to me: “What do you see, Aʹmos?” So I said: “A plumb line.” Jehovah then said: “Here I am putting a plumb line among my people Israel. I will no longer pardon them.</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">9  The high places of Isaac will be desolated, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be devastated; and I will come against the house of Jer·o·boʹam with a sword.”</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">10  Am·a·ziʹah the priest of Bethʹel sent this message to King Jer·o·boʹam of Israel: “Aʹmos is conspiring against you right in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot put up with all his words.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">11  For this is what Aʹmos says, ‘Jer·o·boʹam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile from its land.’”</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">12  Am·a·ziʹah then said to Aʹmos: “O visionary, go, run away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and there you may prophesy.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">13  But you must no longer prophesy at Bethʹel, for it is the sanctuary of a king and the house of a kingdom.”</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">14  Then Aʹmos answered Am·a·ziʹah: “I was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdsman, and I took care of sycamore fig trees.</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">15  But Jehovah took me away from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">16  So now hear the word of Jehovah: ‘You are saying, “Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.”</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">17  Therefore this is what Jehovah says: “Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be apportioned out with a measuring line, and you yourself will die in an unclean land; and Israel will surely go into exile from its land.”’”</span></p></level1>
