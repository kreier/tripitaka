<p><span id="p615" class="sentence">Now the men of Israel had sworn this oath in Mizʹpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter to a man from Benjamin as a wife.”</span>
<span id="p616" class="sentence">2  Consequently, the people came to Bethʹel and sat there before the true God until evening, crying out and weeping bitterly.</span>
<span id="p617" class="sentence">3  And they were saying: “Why, O Jehovah the God of Israel, has this happened in Israel? Why should one tribe be missing today from Israel?”</span>
<span id="p618" class="sentence">4  And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings.</span>
<span id="p619" class="sentence">5  Then the people of Israel said: “Who of all the tribes of Israel did not come up to assemble before Jehovah?” for they had taken a great oath that anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah would be put to death without fail.</span>
<span id="p620" class="sentence">6  So the people of Israel felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin their brother. They said: “Today one tribe has been chopped off from Israel.</span>
<span id="p621" class="sentence">7  What should we do to provide wives for those who are left, now that we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives?”</span>
<span id="p622" class="sentence">8  They asked: “Who among the tribes of Israel did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah?” It so happened that no one had come from Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad into the camp where the congregation was.</span>
<span id="p623" class="sentence">9  When the people were counted, they saw that none of the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad were there.</span>
<span id="p624" class="sentence">10  So the assembly sent there 12,000 of the mightiest men. They commanded them: “Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad with the sword, even the women and the children.</span>
<span id="p625" class="sentence">11  This is what you should do: Every male, as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male, you should devote to destruction.”</span>
<span id="p626" class="sentence">12  Among the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, they found 400 girls who were virgins, who had never had sexual relations with a man. So they brought them to the camp at Shiʹloh, which is in the land of Caʹnaan.</span>
<span id="p627" class="sentence">13  Then all the assembly sent a message to the Benʹja·min·ites on the crag of Rimʹmon and offered them peace.</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">14  So Benjamin came back at that time. They gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, but they did not find enough for them.</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">15  And the people felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin because Jehovah had made a division among the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">16  The elders of the assembly said: “What should we do to provide wives for the remaining men, since all the women were annihilated out of Benjamin?”</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">17  They replied: “There should be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out of Israel.</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">18  But we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters, because the people of Israel have sworn: ‘Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">19  Then they said: “Look! There is a festival of Jehovah from year to year in Shiʹloh, which is north of Bethʹel and east of the highway that goes up from Bethʹel to Sheʹchem and south of Le·boʹnah.”</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">20  So they commanded the men of Benjamin: “Go and set an ambush in the vineyards.</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">21  And when you see the young women of Shiʹloh come out to join in their circle dances, each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of Shiʹloh, and you should return to the land of Benjamin.</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">22  And should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us, we will then tell them, ‘Show us favor for their sakes, because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty.’”</span>
<span id="p637" class="sentence">23  So the men of Benjamin did just that, and they each carried off a wife from the women who were dancing. After that they went back to their inheritance and rebuilt their cities and settled in them.</span>
<span id="p638" class="sentence">24  And the Israelites dispersed from there at that time, each one to his tribe and his family, and they departed from there, each one to his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p639" class="sentence">25  In those days there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.</span></p></level1>
