<p><span id="p489" class="sentence">There was a man of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im named Miʹcah.</span>
<span id="p490" class="sentence">2  He said to his mother: “The 1,100 silver pieces that were taken from you about which you pronounced a curse, which I heard—look! the silver is with me. I was the one who took it.” At that his mother said: “May Jehovah bless my son.”</span>
<span id="p491" class="sentence">3  So he gave the 1,100 pieces of silver back to his mother, but his mother said: “I will without fail sanctify the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue. Now I give it back to you.”</span>
<span id="p492" class="sentence">4  After he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 silver pieces and gave them to the silversmith. He made a carved image and a metal statue; and they were put in Miʹcah’s house.</span>
<span id="p493" class="sentence">5  This man Miʹcah had a house of gods, and he made an ephʹod and teraphim statues and installed one of his sons to serve as priest for him.</span>
<span id="p494" class="sentence">6  In those days, there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.</span>
<span id="p495" class="sentence">7  Now there was a young man of Bethʹle·hem in Judah who was of the family of Judah. He was a Levite who had been living there for a time.</span>
<span id="p496" class="sentence">8  The man left the city of Bethʹle·hem in Judah to find a place to live. While on his journey, he came to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, to the house of Miʹcah.</span>
<span id="p497" class="sentence">9  Then Miʹcah said to him: “Where do you come from?” He replied: “I am a Levite from Bethʹle·hem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to live.”</span>
<span id="p498" class="sentence">10  So Miʹcah said to him: “Stay with me and serve as a father and a priest for me. I will give you ten silver pieces a year and a set of garments and your food.” So the Levite went in.</span>
<span id="p499" class="sentence">11  Thus the Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons.</span>
<span id="p500" class="sentence">12  Furthermore, Miʹcah installed the Levite to serve as a priest for him, and he lived in the house of Miʹcah.</span>
<span id="p501" class="sentence">13  Then Miʹcah said: “Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, for the Levite has become my priest.”</span></p></level1>
