<level1><h1 id="p333">Chapter 13</h1>
<p><span id="p334" class="sentence">This is what Jehovah told me: “Go and buy a linen belt for yourself and put it around your waist, but do not dip it in water.”</span>
<span id="p335" class="sentence">2  So I bought the belt according to the word of Jehovah and put it around my waist.</span>
<span id="p336" class="sentence">3  And the word of Jehovah came to me a second time:</span>
<span id="p337" class="sentence">4  “Take the belt that you bought and are wearing and get up, go to the Eu·phraʹtes, and hide it there in a cleft of the crag.”</span>
<span id="p338" class="sentence">5  So I went and hid it by the Eu·phraʹtes, just as Jehovah had commanded me.</span>
<span id="p339" class="sentence">6  But many days later Jehovah said to me: “Get up, go to the Eu·phraʹtes, and take from there the belt that I commanded you to hide there.”</span>
<span id="p340" class="sentence">7  So I went to the Eu·phraʹtes and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, and I saw that the belt had been ruined; it was completely useless.</span>
<span id="p341" class="sentence">8  Then the word of Jehovah came to me:</span>
<span id="p342" class="sentence">9  “This is what Jehovah says, ‘In the same way I will destroy the pride of Judah and the immense pride of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p343" class="sentence">10  These evil people who refuse to obey my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart, and who are following other gods, serving and bowing down to them, will become just like this belt that is completely useless.’</span>
<span id="p344" class="sentence">11  ‘For just as a belt clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me,’ declares Jehovah, ‘to become to me a people, a name, a praise, and something beautiful. But they did not obey.’</span>
<span id="p345" class="sentence">12  “And you must also give this message to them, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: “Every large jar should be filled with wine.”’ And they will reply to you, ‘Do we not already know that every large jar should be filled with wine?’</span>
<span id="p346" class="sentence">13  Then say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Here I am filling with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land, the kings sitting on the throne of David, the priests and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p347" class="sentence">14  And I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike,” declares Jehovah. “I will not show compassion or feel any sorrow or have any mercy on them; nothing will stop me from bringing them to ruin.”’</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">15  Hear and pay attention.
Do not be haughty, for Jehovah has spoken.</span>
<span id="p349" class="sentence">16  Give glory to Jehovah your GodBefore he brings darknessAnd before your feet stumble on the mountains at dusk.
You will hope for the light,But he will bring deep shadow;He will turn it into thick gloom.</span>
<span id="p350" class="sentence">17  And if you refuse to listen,I will weep in secret because of your pride.
I will shed many tears, and my eyes will stream with tears,Because the flock of Jehovah has been carried away captive.</span>
<span id="p351" class="sentence">18  Tell the king and the queen mother, ‘Sit in a lower place,For your beautiful crown will fall from your head.’</span>
<span id="p352" class="sentence">19  The cities of the south are shut, with no one to open them.
All of Judah has been taken into exile, taken completely into exile.</span>
<span id="p353" class="sentence">20  Raise your eyes and see those coming from the north.
Where is the flock you were given, your beautiful sheep?</span>
<span id="p354" class="sentence">21  What will you say when your punishment comesFrom your close friends whom you cultivated from the start?
Will not birth pains seize you, like those of a woman giving birth?</span>
<span id="p355" class="sentence">22  And when you say in your heart, ‘Why have these things befallen me?’
It is because of your great error that your skirts have been stripped off
And your heels have been treated violently.</span>
<span id="p356" class="sentence">23  Can a Cushʹite change his skin, or a leopard its spots?
If so, then you can do good,You who are trained to do bad.</span>
<span id="p357" class="sentence">24  So I will scatter them like straw blown by the desert wind.</span>
<span id="p358" class="sentence">25  This is your lot, the portion that I have measured out to you,” declares Jehovah,“Because you have forgotten me and you trust in lies.</span>
<span id="p359" class="sentence">26  Therefore, I will lift up your skirts over your face,And your shame will be seen,</span>
<span id="p360" class="sentence">27  Your acts of adultery and your lustful neighing,Your obscene prostitution.
On the hills, in the field,I have seen your disgusting behavior.
Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
How much longer will you remain unclean?”</span></p></level1>
