<level1><h1 id="p21">Chapter 2</h1>
<p><span id="p22" class="sentence">The word of Jehovah came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">2  “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, ‘This is what Jehovah says:
“I well remember the devotion of your youth,The love you showed when you were engaged to marry,How you followed me in the wilderness,In a land not sown with seed.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">3  Israel was holy to Jehovah, the firstfruits of his harvest.”’
‘Anyone devouring him would become guilty.
Disaster would come upon them,’ declares Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">4  Hear the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob,And all you families of the house of Israel.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">5  This is what Jehovah says:
“What fault did your forefathers find in me,So that they strayed so far from me,And they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves?</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">6  They did not ask, ‘Where is Jehovah,The One who brought us out of the land of Egypt,Who led us through the wilderness,Through a land of deserts and pits,Through a land of drought and of deep shadow,Through a land where no man travelsAnd where no humans dwell?’</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">7  I then brought you to a land of orchards,To eat its fruitage and its good things.
But you came in and defiled my land;You made my inheritance something detestable.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">8  The priests did not ask, ‘Where is Jehovah?’
Those handling the Law did not know me,The shepherds rebelled against me,The prophets prophesied by Baʹal,And they followed those who could bring no benefit.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">9  ‘So I will contend further with you,’ declares Jehovah,‘And I will contend with the sons of your sons.’</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">10  ‘But cross over to the coastlands of the Kitʹtim and see.
Yes, send to Keʹdar and consider carefully;See whether anything like this has happened.</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">11  Has a nation ever changed its gods for those that are not gods?
But my own people have exchanged my glory for what is useless.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">12  Stare in amazement at this, you heavens;Shudder in absolute horror,’ declares Jehovah,</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">13  ‘Because my people have done two bad things:
They have abandoned me, the source of living water,And dug for themselves cisterns,Broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.’</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">14  ‘Is Israel a servant or a slave born in the household?
Then why has he been given over to plunder?</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">15  Against him young lions roar;They have raised their voice.
They made his land an object of horror.
His cities have been set on fire, so that there is no inhabitant.</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">16  The people of Noph and Tahʹpan·es feed on the crown of your head.</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">17  Have you not brought this on yourselfBy abandoning Jehovah your GodWhile he was leading you in the way?</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">18  Now why do you wish for the way to EgyptTo drink the waters of Shiʹhor?
Why do you wish for the way to As·syrʹi·aTo drink the waters of the River?</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">19  Your wickedness should correct you,And your own unfaithfulness should reprove you.
Know and realize how bad and bitter it isTo abandon Jehovah your God;You have shown no fear of me,’ declares the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">20  ‘For long ago I smashed your yokeAnd tore off your shackles.
But you said: “I am not going to serve,”
For on every high hill and under every luxuriant treeYou were lying sprawled out, prostituting yourself.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">21  I planted you as a choice red vine, all of it pure seed;So how have you turned into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine before me?’</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">22  ‘Though you should wash with soda and use much lye,Your guilt would still be a stain before me,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">23  How can you say, ‘I have not defiled myself.
I have not followed the Baʹals’?
Look at your way in the valley.
Consider what you have done.
You are like a swift, young she-camel,Aimlessly running back and forth in her ways,</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">24  A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness,Sniffing the wind in her lust.
Who can restrain her when she is in heat?
None of those looking for her will need to weary themselves.
In her season they will find her.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">25  Keep your feet from going bareAnd your throat from thirst.
But you said, ‘It is hopeless!
No! I have fallen in love with strangers,And I will follow them.’</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">26  Like the shame of a thief when he is caught,So the house of Israel has been put to shame,They, their kings and their princes,Their priests and their prophets.</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">27  They say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’
And to a stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’
But to me they turn their back and not their face.
And in the time of their calamity they will say,‘Rise up and save us!’</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">28  Now where are your gods that you made for yourself?
Let them rise up if they can save you in your time of calamity,For your gods have become as numerous as your cities, O Judah.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">29  ‘Why do you keep contending against me?
Why have all of you rebelled against me?’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">30  I have struck your sons in vain.
They would accept no discipline;Your own sword devoured your prophets,Like a marauding lion.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">31  O generation, consider for yourselves the word of Jehovah.
Have I become like a wilderness to IsraelOr a land of oppressive darkness?
Why have these, my people, said, ‘We roam freely.
We will come to you no more’?</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">32  Can a virgin forget her ornaments,A bride her breastbands?
And yet my own people have forgotten me for countless days.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">33  How skillfully, O woman, you set your course to seek love!
You have trained yourself in the ways of wickedness.</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">34  Even your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor ones,Though I did not find them in the act of breaking in;It is on all your skirts.</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">35  But you say, ‘I am innocent.
Surely his anger has turned back from me.’
Now I am bringing judgment against youBecause you say, ‘I have not sinned.’</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">36  Why do you treat so lightly your unstable course?
You will become ashamed of Egypt too,Just as you became ashamed of As·syrʹi·a.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">37  For this reason also you will go out with your hands on your head,For Jehovah has rejected those in whom you put confidence;They will not bring you success.”</span></p></level1>
