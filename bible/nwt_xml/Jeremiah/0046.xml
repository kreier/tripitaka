<p><span id="p1146" class="sentence">This is the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations:</span>
<span id="p1147" class="sentence">2  For Egypt, concerning the army of Pharʹaoh Neʹcho the king of Egypt, who was along the Eu·phraʹtes River and was defeated at Carʹche·mish by King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon in the fourth year of Je·hoiʹa·kim son of Jo·siʹah, the king of Judah:</span>
<span id="p1148" class="sentence">3  “Prepare your bucklers and large shields,And advance to the battle.</span>
<span id="p1149" class="sentence">4  Harness the horses and mount, you horsemen.
Take your positions and put on your helmets.
Polish the lances and put on your coats of mail.</span>
<span id="p1150" class="sentence">5  ‘Why do I see them terror-stricken?
They are retreating, their warriors are crushed.
They have fled in panic, their warriors have not turned around.
There is terror all around,’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1151" class="sentence">6  ‘The swift cannot flee, and the warriors cannot escape.
In the north, by the bank of the Eu·phraʹtes River,They have stumbled and fallen.’</span>
<span id="p1152" class="sentence">7  Who is this coming up like the Nile River,Like the rivers of surging waters?</span>
<span id="p1153" class="sentence">8  Egypt comes up just like the Nile River,Like rivers of surging waters,And it says, ‘I will go up and cover the earth.
I will destroy the city and those inhabiting it.’</span>
<span id="p1154" class="sentence">9  Go up, you horses!
Drive madly, you chariots!
Let the warriors advance,Cush and Put, who handle the shield,And the Luʹdim, who handle and bend the bow.</span>
<span id="p1155" class="sentence">10  “That day belongs to the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, the day of vengeance for taking revenge on his adversaries. And the sword will devour and satisfy itself and take its fill of their blood, for the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has a sacrifice in the land of the north by the Eu·phraʹtes River.</span>
<span id="p1156" class="sentence">11  Go up to Gilʹe·ad to get balsam,O virgin daughter of Egypt.
In vain you have multiplied your remedies,For there is no cure for you.</span>
<span id="p1157" class="sentence">12  The nations have heard your dishonor,And your outcry has filled the land.
For warrior stumbles against warrior,And they both fall down together.”</span>
<span id="p1158" class="sentence">13  This is the word that Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet regarding the coming of King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon to strike down the land of Egypt:</span>
<span id="p1159" class="sentence">14  “Declare it in Egypt, proclaim it in Migʹdol.
Proclaim it in Noph and in Tahʹpan·hes.
Say, ‘Take your positions and prepare yourselves,For a sword will devour all around you.</span>
<span id="p1160" class="sentence">15  Why have your powerful men been swept away?
They did not stand their ground,For Jehovah has pushed them down.</span>
<span id="p1161" class="sentence">16  In great numbers they are stumbling and falling.
They are saying to one another:
“Get up! Let us return to our people and our homelandBecause of the cruel sword.”’</span>
<span id="p1162" class="sentence">17  There they have proclaimed,‘Pharʹaoh king of Egypt is just a meaningless noiseWho has let the opportunity pass by.’</span>
<span id="p1163" class="sentence">18  ‘As surely as I am alive,’ declares the King, whose name is Jehovah of armies,‘He will come in like Taʹbor among the mountainsAnd like Carʹmel by the sea.</span>
<span id="p1164" class="sentence">19  Prepare your baggage for exile,O daughter inhabiting Egypt.
For Noph will become an object of horror;It will be set afire and left without an inhabitant.</span>
<span id="p1165" class="sentence">20  Egypt is like a good-looking heifer,But stinging flies will come against her from the north.</span>
<span id="p1166" class="sentence">21  Even her hired soldiers in her midst are like fattened calves,But they have also turned back and fled together.
They could not stand their ground,For the day of their disaster has come upon them,Their time of reckoning.’</span>
<span id="p1167" class="sentence">22  ‘Her sound is like that of a slithering serpent,For they come after her in force, with axes,Like men cutting down trees.</span>
<span id="p1168" class="sentence">23  They will cut down her forest,’ declares Jehovah, ‘though it seemed impenetrable.
For they are more numerous than locusts, without number.</span>
<span id="p1169" class="sentence">24  The daughter of Egypt will be put to shame.
She will be handed over to the people of the north.’</span>
<span id="p1170" class="sentence">25  “Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Now I am turning my attention to Aʹmon from No, to Pharʹaoh, to Egypt, to her gods, and to her kings—yes, to Pharʹaoh and all those trusting in him.’</span>
<span id="p1171" class="sentence">26  “‘And I will hand them over to those seeking to take their life, to King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon and his servants. But afterward she will be inhabited as in times past,’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1172" class="sentence">27  ‘As for you, do not be afraid, my servant Jacob,And do not be terrified, O Israel.
For I will save you from far awayAnd your offspring from the land of their captivity.
Jacob will return and be calm and undisturbed,With no one to make them afraid.</span>
<span id="p1173" class="sentence">28  So do not be afraid, my servant Jacob,’ declares Jehovah, ‘for I am with you.
I will make an extermination among all the nations where I dispersed you,But you I will not exterminate.
I will discipline you to the proper degree,But I will by no means leave you unpunished.’”</span></p></level1>
