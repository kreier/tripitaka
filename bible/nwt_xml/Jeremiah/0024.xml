<p><span id="p603" class="sentence">Then Jehovah showed me two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon had carried into exile Jec·o·niʹah son of Je·hoiʹa·kim, the king of Judah, along with the princes of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metalworkers; he took them from Jerusalem to Babylon.</span>
<span id="p604" class="sentence">2  One basket had very good figs, like early figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.</span>
<span id="p605" class="sentence">3  Jehovah then asked me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” So I said: “Figs; the good figs are very good, but the bad ones are very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”</span>
<span id="p606" class="sentence">4  Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p607" class="sentence">5  “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard in a good way the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chal·deʹans.</span>
<span id="p608" class="sentence">6  I will keep my eye on them for their good, and I will cause them to return to this land. I will build them up, and I will not tear down; I will plant them, and I will not uproot.</span>
<span id="p609" class="sentence">7  And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah. They will become my people, and I will become their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.</span>
<span id="p610" class="sentence">8  “‘But concerning the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, this is what Jehovah says: “So I will regard King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah, his princes, the remnant of Jerusalem who are left in this land, and those who are dwelling in the land of Egypt.</span>
<span id="p611" class="sentence">9  I will make them an object of horror and calamity to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach, a proverbial saying, a cause for ridicule, and a curse in all the places to which I disperse them.</span>
<span id="p612" class="sentence">10  And I will send against them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until they have perished from the land that I gave to them and to their forefathers.”’”</span></p></level1>
