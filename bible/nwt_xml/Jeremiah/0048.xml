<level1><h1 id="p1182">Chapter 48</h1>
<p><span id="p1183" class="sentence">For Moʹab, this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says:
“Woe to Neʹbo, for she has been destroyed!
Kir·i·a·thaʹim has been put to shame and captured.
The secure refuge has been put to shame and shattered.</span>
<span id="p1184" class="sentence">2  They no longer praise Moʹab.
In Heshʹbon they have plotted her downfall:
‘Come, let us put an end to her as a nation.’
You too, O Madʹmen, should keep silent,For the sword is following you.</span>
<span id="p1185" class="sentence">3  There is the sound of an outcry from Hor·o·naʹim,Of destruction and great collapse.</span>
<span id="p1186" class="sentence">4  Moʹab has been broken down.
Her little ones cry out.</span>
<span id="p1187" class="sentence">5  On the ascent of Luʹhith they weep continually as they climb.
And on the way down from Hor·o·naʹim they hear cries of distress over the catastrophe.</span>
<span id="p1188" class="sentence">6  Flee, escape for your lives!
You must become like a juniper tree in the wilderness.</span>
<span id="p1189" class="sentence">7  Because you trust in your works and in your treasures,You will also be captured.
And Cheʹmosh will go into exile,Together with his priests and his princes.</span>
<span id="p1190" class="sentence">8  The destroyer will come in on every city,And no city will escape.
The valley will perish,And the level land will be annihilated, just as Jehovah has said.</span>
<span id="p1191" class="sentence">9  Set up a marker for Moʹab,For as she falls into ruins she will flee,And her cities will become an object of horror,Without an inhabitant.</span>
<span id="p1192" class="sentence">10  Cursed is the one who carries out the mission of Jehovah neglectfully!
Cursed is the one who holds back his sword from bloodshed!</span>
<span id="p1193" class="sentence">11  The Moʹab·ites have been undisturbed since their youth,Like wine that has settled on the dregs.
They have not been poured from one vessel into another,And they have never gone into exile.
That is why their taste has remained the same,And their aroma has not changed.</span>
<span id="p1194" class="sentence">12  “‘Therefore look! the days are coming,’ declares Jehovah, ‘when I will send men to overturn them. They will turn them over and empty out their vessels, and they will smash their large jars to pieces.</span>
<span id="p1195" class="sentence">13  And the Moʹab·ites will be ashamed of Cheʹmosh, just as the house of Israel is ashamed of Bethʹel, which was their confidence.</span>
<span id="p1196" class="sentence">14  How dare you say: “We are mighty warriors, ready for battle”?’</span>
<span id="p1197" class="sentence">15  ‘Moʹab has been destroyed,Her cities have been invaded,And their choicest young men have been slaughtered,’
Declares the King, whose name is Jehovah of armies.</span>
<span id="p1198" class="sentence">16  The disaster on the Moʹab·ites is coming soon,And their downfall is approaching quickly.</span>
<span id="p1199" class="sentence">17  All those around them will have to sympathize with them,All those knowing their name.
Tell them: ‘O how the mighty rod has been broken, the staff of beauty!’</span>
<span id="p1200" class="sentence">18  Come down from your glory,And sit down in thirst, O daughter inhabiting Diʹbon,For the destroyer of Moʹab has come against you,And he will bring your fortified places to ruin.</span>
<span id="p1201" class="sentence">19  Stand by the road and watch, inhabitant of A·roʹer.
Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ‘What has happened?’</span>
<span id="p1202" class="sentence">20  Moʹab has been put to shame and struck with terror.
Wail and cry out.
Proclaim in Arʹnon that Moʹab has been destroyed.</span>
<span id="p1203" class="sentence">21  “Judgment has come to the level land, against Hoʹlon, Jaʹhaz, and Mephʹa·ath;</span>
<span id="p1204" class="sentence">22  against Diʹbon, Neʹbo, and Beth-dib·la·thaʹim;</span>
<span id="p1205" class="sentence">23  against Kir·i·a·thaʹim, Beth-gaʹmul, and Beth-meʹon;</span>
<span id="p1206" class="sentence">24  against Keʹri·oth and Bozʹrah; and against all the cities of the land of Moʹab, those far and near.</span>
<span id="p1207" class="sentence">25  ‘The strength of Moʹab has been cut down;His arm has been broken,’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1208" class="sentence">26  ‘Make him drunk, for he has exalted himself against Jehovah.
Moʹab wallows in his vomit,And he is an object of ridicule.</span>
<span id="p1209" class="sentence">27  Was Israel not an object of ridicule to you?
Was he found among thieves,So that you should shake your head and speak against him?</span>
<span id="p1210" class="sentence">28  Leave the cities and live on the crag, inhabitants of Moʹab,And become like a dove that nests along the sides of the gorge.’”</span>
<span id="p1211" class="sentence">29  “We have heard about the pride of Moʹab—he is very haughty—About his arrogance, his pride, his haughtiness, and the loftiness of his heart.”</span>
<span id="p1212" class="sentence">30  “‘I know his fury,’ declares Jehovah,‘But his empty talk will come to nothing.
They will do nothing.</span>
<span id="p1213" class="sentence">31  That is why I will wail over Moʹab,For all Moʹab I will cry outAnd moan for the men of Kir-heʹres.</span>
<span id="p1214" class="sentence">32  With more than the weeping for Jaʹzer,I will weep for you, O vine of Sibʹmah.
Your flourishing shoots have crossed the sea.
To the sea, to Jaʹzer, they have reached.
Upon your summer fruit and your grape harvestThe destroyer has descended.</span>
<span id="p1215" class="sentence">33  Rejoicing and joyfulness have been removed from the orchardAnd from the land of Moʹab.
I have caused the wine to stop flowing from the winepress.
No one will be treading with shouts of joy.
The shouting will be different shouting.’”</span>
<span id="p1216" class="sentence">34  “‘There is an outcry from Heshʹbon clear to E·le·aʹleh.
They raise their voice clear to Jaʹhaz,From Zoʹar to Hor·o·naʹim to Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah.
Even the waters of Nimʹrim will become desolate.</span>
<span id="p1217" class="sentence">35  I will cause to cease from Moʹab,’ declares Jehovah,‘The one bringing an offering on the high placeAnd the one making sacrifices to his god.</span>
<span id="p1218" class="sentence">36  That is why my heart will moan for Moʹab like a flute,And my heart will moan for the men of Kir-heʹres like a flute.
For the wealth he has produced will perish.</span>
<span id="p1219" class="sentence">37  For every head is bald,And every beard is clipped.
There are cuts on every hand,And there is sackcloth on their hips!’”</span>
<span id="p1220" class="sentence">38  “‘On all the roofs of MoʹabAnd in all her public squares,There is nothing but wailing.
For I have broken MoʹabLike a discarded jar,’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1221" class="sentence">39  ‘How she is terrified! Wail!
How Moʹab has turned his back in shame!
Moʹab has become an object of ridicule,Something terrifying to all those around him.’”</span>
<span id="p1222" class="sentence">40  “For this is what Jehovah says:
‘Look! Just like an eagle that swoops down,He will spread his wings over Moʹab.</span>
<span id="p1223" class="sentence">41  The towns will be captured,And her strongholds will be seized.
In that day the heart of Moʹab’s warriorsWill be like the heart of a woman in childbirth.’”</span>
<span id="p1224" class="sentence">42  “‘And Moʹab will be annihilated from being a people,For it is against Jehovah that he has exalted himself.</span>
<span id="p1225" class="sentence">43  Terror and the pit and the trap are before you,O inhabitant of Moʹab,’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1226" class="sentence">44  ‘Anyone fleeing the terror will fall into the pit,And anyone coming up from the pit will be caught in the trap.’
‘For I will bring on Moʹab the year of their punishment,’ declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1227" class="sentence">45  ‘In the shadow of Heshʹbon, those fleeing stand powerless.
For a fire will come out of HeshʹbonAnd a flame from within Siʹhon.
It will consume the forehead of MoʹabAnd the skull of the sons of tumult.’</span>
<span id="p1228" class="sentence">46  ‘Woe to you, O Moʹab!
The people of Cheʹmosh have perished.
For your sons have been taken captive,And your daughters have gone into exile.</span>
<span id="p1229" class="sentence">47  But I will gather the captives of Moʹab in the final part of the days,’ declares Jehovah.
‘Down to this point is the judgment on Moʹab.’”</span></p></level1>
