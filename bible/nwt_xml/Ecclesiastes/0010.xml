<level1><h1 id="p188">Chapter 10</h1>
<p><span id="p189" class="sentence">As dead flies cause the perfumer’s oil to stink and bubble, so a little foolishness outweighs wisdom and glory.</span>
<span id="p190" class="sentence">2  The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way.</span>
<span id="p191" class="sentence">3  In whatever way the fool walks, he is lacking good sense, and he lets everyone know that he is a fool.</span>
<span id="p192" class="sentence">4  If the anger of a ruler should flare up against you, do not leave your place, for calmness allays great sins.</span>
<span id="p193" class="sentence">5  There is something distressing that I have seen under the sun, the sort of mistake made by those in power:</span>
<span id="p194" class="sentence">6  Foolishness is put in many high positions, but the rich remain in low positions.</span>
<span id="p195" class="sentence">7  I have seen servants on horseback but princes walking on foot just like servants.</span>
<span id="p196" class="sentence">8  The one who digs a pit may fall into it; and the one who breaks through a stone wall may be bitten by a snake.</span>
<span id="p197" class="sentence">9  The one who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and the one who splits logs may be endangered by them.</span>
<span id="p198" class="sentence">10  If an iron tool is dull and one does not sharpen its edge, he will need to exert much effort. But wisdom helps to achieve success.</span>
<span id="p199" class="sentence">11  If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the skilled charmer.</span>
<span id="p200" class="sentence">12  The words from the mouth of the wise one bring favor, but the lips of the stupid one are his ruin.</span>
<span id="p201" class="sentence">13  The first words out of his mouth are foolishness, and his last words are disastrous madness.</span>
<span id="p202" class="sentence">14  But the fool keeps on speaking.
A man does not know what will happen; who can tell him what will come after him?</span>
<span id="p203" class="sentence">15  The hard work of the stupid one wears him out, for he does not even know how to find his way to the city.</span>
<span id="p204" class="sentence">16  How terrible for a land when the king is a boy and the princes start their feasting in the morning!</span>
<span id="p205" class="sentence">17  How happy for the land when the king is the son of nobles and the princes eat at the proper time for strength, not for drunkenness!</span>
<span id="p206" class="sentence">18  Because of extreme laziness the roof beams sag, and because of idle hands the house leaks.</span>
<span id="p207" class="sentence">19  Bread is made for laughter, and wine makes life enjoyable; but money answers every need.</span>
<span id="p208" class="sentence">20  Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king, and do not curse the rich in your bedroom; for a bird may convey the sound, or a creature with wings may repeat what was said.</span></p></level1>
