<level1><h1 id="p70">Chapter 4</h1>
<p><span id="p71" class="sentence">Again I turned my attention to all the acts of oppression that go on under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and there was no one to comfort them. And their oppressors had the power, and there was no one to comfort them.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">2  And I congratulated the dead who had already died rather than the living who were still alive.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">3  And better off than both of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the distressing deeds that are done under the sun.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">4  And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">5  The stupid one folds his hands while his flesh wastes away.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">6  Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">7  I turned my attention to another example of futility under the sun:</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">8  There is a man who is all alone, without any companion; he has no son or brother, but there is no end to all his hard work. His eyes are never satisfied with riches. But does he ask himself, ‘For whom am I working hard and depriving myself of good things’? This too is futility and a miserable occupation.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">9  Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their hard work.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">10  For if one of them falls, the other can help his partner up. But what will happen to the one who falls with no one to help him up?</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">11  Moreover, if two lie down together, they will stay warm, but how can just one keep warm?</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">12  And someone may overpower one alone, but two together can take a stand against him. And a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn apart.</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">13  Better is a poor but wise child than an old but stupid king, who no longer has enough sense to heed a warning.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">14  For he went out from prison to become king, although in that one’s kingship he was born poor.</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">15  I considered all those alive who walk about under the sun, as well as how it goes with the young successor who stands up in the other’s place.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">16  Although there is no end to all his supporters, those who come later will not be happy with him. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.</span></p></level1>
