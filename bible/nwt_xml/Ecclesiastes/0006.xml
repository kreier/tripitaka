<level1><h1 id="p108">Chapter 6</h1>
<p><span id="p109" class="sentence">There is another tragedy that I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">2  The true God gives a man riches and material possessions and glory, so that he lacks nothing that he desires; yet the true God does not enable him to enjoy them, although a stranger may enjoy them. This is futility and a severe affliction.</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">3  If a man should become a father a hundred times and live for many years and reach old age, yet he does not enjoy his good things before he reaches the grave, I must say that a stillborn child is better off than he is.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">4  For this one came in vain and went away in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">5  Even though he never saw the sun or knew anything, he is still better off than the former one.</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">6  What is the benefit of living a thousand years twice over but not experiencing enjoyment? Do not all go to the same place?</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">7  All the hard work of a man is to fill his mouth; yet his appetite is never satisfied.</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">8  For what advantage does the wise one have over the stupid one, or of what benefit is it that the poor man knows how to survive?</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">9  Better to enjoy what the eyes see than to wander after one’s desires. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">10  Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is; and he is not able to dispute with the one more powerful than he.</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">11  The more words, the more futility; and what advantage do they bring to man?</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">12  Who knows what is best for a man to do in life during the few days of his futile life, which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell man what will happen under the sun after he is gone?</span></p></level1>
