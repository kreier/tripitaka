<p><span id="p468" class="sentence">At that time Herod, the district ruler, heard the report about Jesus</span>
<span id="p469" class="sentence">2  and said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He was raised up from the dead, and this is why these powerful works are operating in him.”</span>
<span id="p470" class="sentence">3  Herod had arrested John and had bound him and imprisoned him because of He·roʹdi·as, the wife of Philip his brother.</span>
<span id="p471" class="sentence">4  For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</span>
<span id="p472" class="sentence">5  However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet.</span>
<span id="p473" class="sentence">6  But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated, the daughter of He·roʹdi·as danced for the occasion and pleased Herod so much</span>
<span id="p474" class="sentence">7  that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</span>
<span id="p475" class="sentence">8  Then she, at her mother’s prompting, said: “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”</span>
<span id="p476" class="sentence">9  Grieved though he was, the king, out of regard for his oaths and for those dining with him, commanded it to be given.</span>
<span id="p477" class="sentence">10  So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.</span>
<span id="p478" class="sentence">11  His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</span>
<span id="p479" class="sentence">12  Later his disciples came and removed his corpse and buried him; then they came and reported to Jesus.</span>
<span id="p480" class="sentence">13  At hearing this, Jesus departed from there by boat into an isolated place to be alone. But the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.</span>
<span id="p481" class="sentence">14  When he came ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones.</span>
<span id="p482" class="sentence">15  But when evening fell, his disciples came to him and said: “The place is isolated and the hour is already late; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”</span>
<span id="p483" class="sentence">16  However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave; you give them something to eat.”</span>
<span id="p484" class="sentence">17  They said to him: “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”</span>
<span id="p485" class="sentence">18  He said: “Bring them here to me.”</span>
<span id="p486" class="sentence">19  And he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said a blessing, and after breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span>
<span id="p487" class="sentence">20  So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, 12 baskets full.</span>
<span id="p488" class="sentence">21  Now those eating were about 5,000 men, as well as women and young children.</span>
<span id="p489" class="sentence">22  Then, without delay, he made his disciples board the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite shore, while he sent the crowds away.</span>
<span id="p490" class="sentence">23  After sending the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.</span>
<span id="p491" class="sentence">24  By now the boat was many hundreds of yards away from land, struggling against the waves because the wind was against them.</span>
<span id="p492" class="sentence">25  But in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</span>
<span id="p493" class="sentence">26  When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out in their fear.</span>
<span id="p494" class="sentence">27  But at once Jesus spoke to them, saying: “Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.”</span>
<span id="p495" class="sentence">28  Peter answered him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.”</span>
<span id="p496" class="sentence">29  He said: “Come!” So Peter got out of the boat and walked over the waters and went toward Jesus.</span>
<span id="p497" class="sentence">30  But looking at the windstorm, he became afraid. And when he started to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!”</span>
<span id="p498" class="sentence">31  Immediately stretching out his hand, Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?”</span>
<span id="p499" class="sentence">32  After they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated.</span>
<span id="p500" class="sentence">33  Then those in the boat did obeisance to him, saying: “You really are God’s Son.”</span>
<span id="p501" class="sentence">34  And they crossed over and came to land in Gen·nesʹa·ret.</span>
<span id="p502" class="sentence">35  On recognizing him, the men of that place sent word into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill.</span>
<span id="p503" class="sentence">36  And they pleaded with him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment, and all those who touched it were made completely well.</span></p></level1>
