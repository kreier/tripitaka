<level1><h1 id="p209">Chapter 8</h1>
<p><span id="p210" class="sentence">After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.</span>
<span id="p211" class="sentence">2  And look! a leper came up and did obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”</span>
<span id="p212" class="sentence">3  So stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to! Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.</span>
<span id="p213" class="sentence">4  Then Jesus said to him: “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for a witness to them.”</span>
<span id="p214" class="sentence">5  When he entered Ca·perʹna·um, an army officer came to him, pleading with him</span>
<span id="p215" class="sentence">6  and saying: “Sir, my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis, and he is suffering terribly.”</span>
<span id="p216" class="sentence">7  He said to him: “When I get there, I will cure him.”</span>
<span id="p217" class="sentence">8  The army officer replied: “Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but just say the word and my servant will be healed.</span>
<span id="p218" class="sentence">9  For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</span>
<span id="p219" class="sentence">10  When Jesus heard that, he was amazed and said to those following him: “I tell you the truth, with no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.</span>
<span id="p220" class="sentence">11  But I tell you that many from east and west will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the heavens;</span>
<span id="p221" class="sentence">12  whereas the sons of the Kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.”</span>
<span id="p222" class="sentence">13  Then Jesus said to the army officer: “Go. Just as you have shown faith, so let it come to pass for you.” And the servant was healed in that hour.</span>
<span id="p223" class="sentence">14  And Jesus, on coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever.</span>
<span id="p224" class="sentence">15  So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him.</span>
<span id="p225" class="sentence">16  But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed ones; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were suffering,</span>
<span id="p226" class="sentence">17  in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: “He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.”</span>
<span id="p227" class="sentence">18  When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to depart for the other side.</span>
<span id="p228" class="sentence">19  And a scribe came up and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</span>
<span id="p229" class="sentence">20  But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”</span>
<span id="p230" class="sentence">21  Then another of the disciples said to him: “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”</span>
<span id="p231" class="sentence">22  Jesus said to him: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.”</span>
<span id="p232" class="sentence">23  And when he went aboard a boat, his disciples followed him.</span>
<span id="p233" class="sentence">24  Now look! a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; but he was sleeping.</span>
<span id="p234" class="sentence">25  And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”</span>
<span id="p235" class="sentence">26  But he said to them: “Why are you so afraid, you with little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in.</span>
<span id="p236" class="sentence">27  So the men were amazed and said: “What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him.”</span>
<span id="p237" class="sentence">28  When he came to the other side into the region of the Gad·a·renesʹ, two demon-possessed men coming out from among the tombs met him. They were unusually fierce, so nobody had the courage to pass by on that road.</span>
<span id="p238" class="sentence">29  And look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”</span>
<span id="p239" class="sentence">30  A long way off from them, a herd of many swine was feeding.</span>
<span id="p240" class="sentence">31  So the demons began to plead with him, saying: “If you expel us, send us into the herd of swine.”</span>
<span id="p241" class="sentence">32  And he said to them: “Go!” With that they came out and went off into the swine, and look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters.</span>
<span id="p242" class="sentence">33  But the herders fled, and going into the city, they reported everything, including the account of the demon-possessed men.</span>
<span id="p243" class="sentence">34  And look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they urged him to depart from their region.</span></p></level1>
