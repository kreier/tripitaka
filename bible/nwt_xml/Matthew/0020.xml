<level1><h1 id="p668">Chapter 20</h1>
<p><span id="p669" class="sentence">“For the Kingdom of the heavens is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.</span>
<span id="p670" class="sentence">2  After he had agreed with the workers for a de·narʹi·us a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span>
<span id="p671" class="sentence">3  Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace;</span>
<span id="p672" class="sentence">4  and to those he said, ‘You too go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is fair.’</span>
<span id="p673" class="sentence">5  So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise.</span>
<span id="p674" class="sentence">6  Finally, about the 11th hour, he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day unemployed?’</span>
<span id="p675" class="sentence">7  They replied, ‘Because nobody has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You too go into the vineyard.’</span>
<span id="p676" class="sentence">8  “When evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last and ending with the first.’</span>
<span id="p677" class="sentence">9  When the 11th-hour men came, they each received a de·narʹi·us.</span>
<span id="p678" class="sentence">10  So when the first came, they assumed that they would receive more, but they too were paid at the rate of a de·narʹi·us.</span>
<span id="p679" class="sentence">11  On receiving it, they began to complain against the master of the house</span>
<span id="p680" class="sentence">12  and said, ‘These last men put in one hour’s work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!’</span>
<span id="p681" class="sentence">13  But he said in reply to one of them, ‘Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a de·narʹi·us, did you not?</span>
<span id="p682" class="sentence">14  Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you.</span>
<span id="p683" class="sentence">15  Do I not have the right to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye envious because I am good?’</span>
<span id="p684" class="sentence">16  In this way, the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.”</span>
<span id="p685" class="sentence">17  While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road:</span>
<span id="p686" class="sentence">18  “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death</span>
<span id="p687" class="sentence">19  and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake; and on the third day he will be raised up.”</span>
<span id="p688" class="sentence">20  Then the mother of the sons of Zebʹe·dee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him.</span>
<span id="p689" class="sentence">21  He said to her: “What do you want?” She replied to him: “Give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your Kingdom.”</span>
<span id="p690" class="sentence">22  Jesus answered: “You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him: “We can.”</span>
<span id="p691" class="sentence">23  He said to them: “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span>
<span id="p692" class="sentence">24  When the ten others heard about it, they became indignant at the two brothers.</span>
<span id="p693" class="sentence">25  But Jesus called them to him and said: “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them.</span>
<span id="p694" class="sentence">26  This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister,</span>
<span id="p695" class="sentence">27  and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.</span>
<span id="p696" class="sentence">28  Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.”</span>
<span id="p697" class="sentence">29  As they were going out of Jerʹi·cho, a large crowd followed him.</span>
<span id="p698" class="sentence">30  And look! two blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”</span>
<span id="p699" class="sentence">31  But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to keep silent; yet they cried all the louder, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”</span>
<span id="p700" class="sentence">32  So Jesus stopped, called them, and said: “What do you want me to do for you?”</span>
<span id="p701" class="sentence">33  They said to him: “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”</span>
<span id="p702" class="sentence">34  Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and they followed him.</span></p></level1>
