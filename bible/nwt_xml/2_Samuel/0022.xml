<level1><h1 id="p602">Chapter 22</h1>
<p><span id="p603" class="sentence">And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of Saul’s hand.</span>
<span id="p604" class="sentence">2  He said:
“Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the One who rescues me.</span>
<span id="p605" class="sentence">3  My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,My shield and my horn of salvation, my secure refugeAnd my place to flee, my savior; you who save me from violence.</span>
<span id="p606" class="sentence">4  I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,And I will be saved from my enemies.</span>
<span id="p607" class="sentence">5  The waves of death broke all around me;Flash floods of worthless men terrified me.</span>
<span id="p608" class="sentence">6  The ropes of the Grave surrounded me;The snares of death confronted me.</span>
<span id="p609" class="sentence">7  In my distress I called on Jehovah,To my God I kept calling.
Then from his temple he heard my voice,And my cry for help reached his ears.</span>
<span id="p610" class="sentence">8  Back and forth the earth began to shake and rock;The foundations of the heavens trembledAnd shook back and forth because he had been angered.</span>
<span id="p611" class="sentence">9  Smoke ascended from his nostrils,And a consuming fire came from his mouth;Glowing coals blazed from him.</span>
<span id="p612" class="sentence">10  He made the heavens bend as he descended,And thick gloom was beneath his feet.</span>
<span id="p613" class="sentence">11  He rode on a cherub and came flying.
He was visible on the wings of a spirit.</span>
<span id="p614" class="sentence">12  Then he put darkness around him as a shelter,In dark waters and thick clouds.</span>
<span id="p615" class="sentence">13  From the brightness before him fiery coals blazed.</span>
<span id="p616" class="sentence">14  Then Jehovah began to thunder from heaven;The Most High made his voice heard.</span>
<span id="p617" class="sentence">15  He shot his arrows and scattered them;Lightning, and he threw them into confusion.</span>
<span id="p618" class="sentence">16  The bed of the sea became visible;The foundations of the land were exposed by the rebuke of Jehovah,By the blast of the breath from his nostrils.</span>
<span id="p619" class="sentence">17  He reached down from on high;He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.</span>
<span id="p620" class="sentence">18  He rescued me from my strong enemy,From those hating me, who were stronger than I was.</span>
<span id="p621" class="sentence">19  They confronted me on the day of my disaster,But Jehovah was my support.</span>
<span id="p622" class="sentence">20  He brought me out into a place of safety;He rescued me because he was pleased with me.</span>
<span id="p623" class="sentence">21  Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;He repays me according to the innocence of my hands.</span>
<span id="p624" class="sentence">22  For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,And I have not wickedly abandoned my God.</span>
<span id="p625" class="sentence">23  All his judgments are before me;I will not deviate from his statutes.</span>
<span id="p626" class="sentence">24  I will remain blameless before him,And I will keep myself from error.</span>
<span id="p627" class="sentence">25  May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,According to my innocence before him.</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">26  With someone loyal you act in loyalty;With the blameless, mighty man, you deal blamelessly;</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">27  With the pure you show yourself pure,But with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">28  For you save those who are humble,But your eyes are against the haughty, and you abase them.</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">29  For you are my lamp, O Jehovah;It is Jehovah who lights up my darkness.</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">30  With your help I can charge against a marauder band;By God’s power I can scale a wall.</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">31  The way of the true God is perfect;The saying of Jehovah is refined.
He is a shield to all those taking refuge in him.</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">32  For who is a God besides Jehovah?
And who is a rock except our God?</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">33  The true God is my strong fortress,And he will make my way perfect.</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">34  He makes my feet like those of a deer;He makes me stand on high places.</span>
<span id="p637" class="sentence">35  He trains my hands for warfare;My arms can bend a bow of copper.</span>
<span id="p638" class="sentence">36  You give me your shield of salvation,And your humility makes me great.</span>
<span id="p639" class="sentence">37  You widen the path for my footsteps;My feet will not slip.</span>
<span id="p640" class="sentence">38  I will pursue my enemies and annihilate them;I will not return until they are wiped out.</span>
<span id="p641" class="sentence">39  And I will wipe them out and crush them, so that they will not rise up;They will fall under my feet.</span>
<span id="p642" class="sentence">40  You will equip me with strength for the battle;You will make my foes collapse under me.</span>
<span id="p643" class="sentence">41  You will make my enemies retreat from me;I will put an end to those who hate me.</span>
<span id="p644" class="sentence">42  They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;They even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them.</span>
<span id="p645" class="sentence">43  I will pound them as fine as the dust of the earth;I will pulverize and trample them like mud in the streets.</span>
<span id="p646" class="sentence">44  You will rescue me from the faultfinding of my people.
You will safeguard me to be the head of nations;A people whom I have not known will serve me.</span>
<span id="p647" class="sentence">45  Foreigners will come cringing before me;What they hear about me will make them obey me.</span>
<span id="p648" class="sentence">46  Foreigners will lose courage;They will come trembling from their strongholds.</span>
<span id="p649" class="sentence">47  Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!
Let the God of the rock of my salvation be exalted.</span>
<span id="p650" class="sentence">48  The true God executes vengeance for me;He subdues the peoples under me;</span>
<span id="p651" class="sentence">49  He rescues me from my enemies.
You lift me high above those who attack me;You save me from the man of violence.</span>
<span id="p652" class="sentence">50  That is why I will thank you, O Jehovah, among the nations,And to your name I will sing praises:</span>
<span id="p653" class="sentence">51  He performs great acts of salvation for his king;He displays loyal love to his anointed one,To David and his offspring forever.”</span></p></level1>
