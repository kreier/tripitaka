<p><span id="p627" class="sentence">“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Exercise faith in God; exercise faith also in me.</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">2  In the house of my Father are many dwelling places. Otherwise, I would have told you, for I am going my way to prepare a place for you.</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">3  Also, if I go my way and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will receive you home to myself, so that where I am you also may be.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">4  And where I am going, you know the way.”</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">5  Thomas said to him: “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?”</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">6  Jesus said to him: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">7  If you men had known me, you would have known my Father also; from this moment on you know him and have seen him.”</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">8  Philip said to him: “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">9  Jesus said to him: “Even after I have been with you men for such a long time, Philip, have you not come to know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also. How is it you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">10  Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me? The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality, but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works.</span>
<span id="p637" class="sentence">11  Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me; otherwise, believe because of the works themselves.</span>
<span id="p638" class="sentence">12  Most truly I say to you, whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these, because I am going my way to the Father.</span>
<span id="p639" class="sentence">13  Also, whatever you ask in my name, I will do this, so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son.</span>
<span id="p640" class="sentence">14  If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.</span>
<span id="p641" class="sentence">15  “If you love me, you will observe my commandments.</span>
<span id="p642" class="sentence">16  And I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper to be with you forever,</span>
<span id="p643" class="sentence">17  the spirit of the truth, which the world cannot receive, because it neither sees it nor knows it. You know it, because it remains with you and is in you.</span>
<span id="p644" class="sentence">18  I will not leave you bereaved. I am coming to you.</span>
<span id="p645" class="sentence">19  In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will see me, because I live and you will live.</span>
<span id="p646" class="sentence">20  In that day you will know that I am in union with my Father and you are in union with me and I am in union with you.</span>
<span id="p647" class="sentence">21  Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.”</span>
<span id="p648" class="sentence">22  Judas, not Is·carʹi·ot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened that you intend to show yourself clearly to us and not to the world?”</span>
<span id="p649" class="sentence">23  In answer Jesus said to him: “If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.</span>
<span id="p650" class="sentence">24  Whoever does not love me does not observe my words. The word that you are hearing is not mine, but belongs to the Father who sent me.</span>
<span id="p651" class="sentence">25  “I have spoken these things to you while I am still with you.</span>
<span id="p652" class="sentence">26  But the helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.</span>
<span id="p653" class="sentence">27  I leave you peace; I give you my peace. I do not give it to you the way that the world gives it. Do not let your hearts be troubled nor let them shrink out of fear.</span>
<span id="p654" class="sentence">28  You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am.</span>
<span id="p655" class="sentence">29  So now I have told you before it occurs, so that you may believe when it does occur.</span>
<span id="p656" class="sentence">30  I will not speak with you much more, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no hold on me.</span>
<span id="p657" class="sentence">31  But for the world to know that I love the Father, I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do. Get up, let us go from here.</span></p></level1>
