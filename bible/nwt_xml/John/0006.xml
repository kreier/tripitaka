<p><span id="p220" class="sentence">After this Jesus set out across the Sea of Galʹi·lee, or Ti·beʹri·as.</span>
<span id="p221" class="sentence">2  And a large crowd kept following him, because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing in healing the sick.</span>
<span id="p222" class="sentence">3  So Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples.</span>
<span id="p223" class="sentence">4  Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.</span>
<span id="p224" class="sentence">5  When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: “Where will we buy bread for these people to eat?”</span>
<span id="p225" class="sentence">6  However, he was saying this to test him, for he knew what he was about to do.</span>
<span id="p226" class="sentence">7  Philip answered him: “Two hundred de·narʹi·i worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get even a little.”</span>
<span id="p227" class="sentence">8  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him:</span>
<span id="p228" class="sentence">9  “Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many?”</span>
<span id="p229" class="sentence">10  Jesus said: “Have the people sit down.” As there was a lot of grass in that place, the men sat down there, about 5,000 in number.</span>
<span id="p230" class="sentence">11  Jesus took the bread, and after giving thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting there; he did likewise with the small fish, and they had as much as they wanted.</span>
<span id="p231" class="sentence">12  But when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples: “Gather together the fragments left over, so that nothing is wasted.”</span>
<span id="p232" class="sentence">13  So they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves.</span>
<span id="p233" class="sentence">14  When the people saw the sign he performed, they began to say: “This really is the Prophet who was to come into the world.”</span>
<span id="p234" class="sentence">15  Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain all alone.</span>
<span id="p235" class="sentence">16  When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,</span>
<span id="p236" class="sentence">17  and boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Ca·perʹna·um. By now it had grown dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span>
<span id="p237" class="sentence">18  Also, the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing.</span>
<span id="p238" class="sentence">19  However, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and getting near the boat, and they became fearful.</span>
<span id="p239" class="sentence">20  But he said to them: “It is I; do not be afraid!”</span>
<span id="p240" class="sentence">21  Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and right away the boat arrived at the land to which they had been heading.</span>
<span id="p241" class="sentence">22  The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no boat there. A small one had been there, but Jesus had not boarded that boat with his disciples, for his disciples had left by themselves.</span>
<span id="p242" class="sentence">23  Boats from Ti·beʹri·as, however, arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span>
<span id="p243" class="sentence">24  So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they boarded their boats and came to Ca·perʹna·um to look for Jesus.</span>
<span id="p244" class="sentence">25  When they found him across the sea, they said to him: “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</span>
<span id="p245" class="sentence">26  Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.</span>
<span id="p246" class="sentence">27  Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for on this one the Father, God himself, has put his seal of approval.”</span>
<span id="p247" class="sentence">28  So they said to him: “What must we do to carry out the works of God?”</span>
<span id="p248" class="sentence">29  In answer Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent.”</span>
<span id="p249" class="sentence">30  Then they said to him: “What are you performing as a sign, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you doing?</span>
<span id="p250" class="sentence">31  Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</span>
<span id="p251" class="sentence">32  Jesus then said to them: “Most truly I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span>
<span id="p252" class="sentence">33  For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span>
<span id="p253" class="sentence">34  So they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread.”</span>
<span id="p254" class="sentence">35  Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all, and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all.</span>
<span id="p255" class="sentence">36  But as I said to you, you have even seen me and yet do not believe.</span>
<span id="p256" class="sentence">37  All those whom the Father gives me will come to me, and I will never drive away the one who comes to me;</span>
<span id="p257" class="sentence">38  for I have come down from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</span>
<span id="p258" class="sentence">39  This is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none out of all those whom he has given me, but that I should resurrect them on the last day.</span>
<span id="p259" class="sentence">40  For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day.”</span>
<span id="p260" class="sentence">41  Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he had said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</span>
<span id="p261" class="sentence">42  And they began saying: “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</span>
<span id="p262" class="sentence">43  In response Jesus said to them: “Stop murmuring among yourselves.</span>
<span id="p263" class="sentence">44  No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him, and I will resurrect him on the last day.</span>
<span id="p264" class="sentence">45  It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned comes to me.</span>
<span id="p265" class="sentence">46  Not that any man has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; this one has seen the Father.</span>
<span id="p266" class="sentence">47  Most truly I say to you, whoever believes has everlasting life.</span>
<span id="p267" class="sentence">48  “I am the bread of life.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">49  Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet they died.</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">50  This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">51  I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and for a fact, the bread that I will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”</span>
<span id="p271" class="sentence">52  Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</span>
<span id="p272" class="sentence">53  So Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.</span>
<span id="p273" class="sentence">54  Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day;</span>
<span id="p274" class="sentence">55  for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">56  Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">57  Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">58  This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when your forefathers ate and yet died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”</span>
<span id="p278" class="sentence">59  He said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue in Ca·perʹna·um.</span>
<span id="p279" class="sentence">60  When they heard this, many of his disciples said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?”</span>
<span id="p280" class="sentence">61  But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: “Does this stumble you?</span>
<span id="p281" class="sentence">62  What, therefore, if you should see the Son of man ascending to where he was before?</span>
<span id="p282" class="sentence">63  It is the spirit that is life-giving; the flesh is of no use at all. The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</span>
<span id="p283" class="sentence">64  But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him.</span>
<span id="p284" class="sentence">65  He went on to say: “This is why I have said to you, no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”</span>
<span id="p285" class="sentence">66  Because of this, many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.</span>
<span id="p286" class="sentence">67  So Jesus said to the Twelve: “You do not want to go also, do you?”</span>
<span id="p287" class="sentence">68  Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life.</span>
<span id="p288" class="sentence">69  We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”</span>
<span id="p289" class="sentence">70  Jesus answered them: “I chose you twelve, did I not? Yet one of you is a slanderer.”</span>
<span id="p290" class="sentence">71  He was, in fact, speaking of Judas the son of Simon Is·carʹi·ot, for this one was going to betray him, although he was one of the Twelve.</span></p></level1>
