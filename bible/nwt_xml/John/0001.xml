<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  This one was in the beginning with God.</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.
What has come into existence</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  And the light is shining in the darkness, but the darkness has not overpowered it.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  There came a man who was sent as a representative of God; his name was John.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  This man came as a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, so that people of all sorts might believe through him.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  He was not that light, but he was meant to bear witness about that light.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, but the world did not know him.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  He came to his own home, but his own people did not accept him.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  However, to all who did receive him, he gave authority to become God’s children, because they were exercising faith in his name.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  And they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of divine favor and truth.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  (John bore witness about him, yes, he cried out: “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, for he existed before me.’”)</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  For we all received from his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  Because the Law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is at the Father’s side is the one who has explained Him.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  This is the witness John gave when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: “Who are you?”</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  And he admitted it and did not deny it, saying: “I am not the Christ.”</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  And they asked him: “What, then? Are you E·liʹjah?” He replied: “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered: “No!”</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">22  So they said to him: “Who are you? Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">23  He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make the way of Jehovah straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">24  Now those sent were from the Pharisees.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">25  So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize if you are not the Christ or E·liʹjah or the Prophet?”</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">26  John answered them: “I baptize in water. One is standing among you whom you do not know,</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">27  the one coming behind me, the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">28  These things took place in Bethʹa·ny across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">29  The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and he said: “See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">30  This is the one about whom I said: ‘Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, for he existed before me.’</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">31  Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was so that he might be made manifest to Israel.”</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">32  John also bore witness, saying: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">33  Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me: ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one who baptizes in holy spirit.’</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">34  And I have seen it, and I have given witness that this one is the Son of God.”</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">35  Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">36  and as he looked at Jesus walking, he said: “See, the Lamb of God!”</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">37  When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">38  Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, he said to them: “What are you looking for?” They said to him: “Rabbi (which means, when translated, “Teacher”), where are you staying?”</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">39  He said to them: “Come, and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">40  Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">41  He first found his own brother Simon and said to him: “We have found the Mes·siʹah” (which means, when translated, “Christ”),</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">42  and he led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked at him, he said: “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Ceʹphas” (which is translated “Peter”).</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">43  The next day he wanted to leave for Galʹi·lee. Jesus then found Philip and said to him: “Be my follower.”</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">44  Now Philip was from Beth·saʹi·da, from the city of Andrew and Peter.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">45  Philip found Na·thanʹa·el and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote: Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazʹa·reth.”</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">46  But Na·thanʹa·el said to him: “Can anything good come out of Nazʹa·reth?” Philip said to him: “Come and see.”</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">47  Jesus saw Na·thanʹa·el coming toward him and said about him: “See, truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">48  Na·thanʹa·el said to him: “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">49  Na·thanʹa·el responded: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.”</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">50  Jesus answered him: “Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see things greater than these.”</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">51  He then said to him: “Most truly I say to you men, you will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.”</span></p></level1>
