<p><span id="p24" class="sentence">And I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">2  So I asked: “Where are you going?”
He replied: “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is her width and what is her length.”</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">3  And look! the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came to meet him.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">4  Then he said to him: “Run over there and tell that young man, ‘“Jerusalem will be inhabited as open rural country, because of all the men and livestock within her.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">5  And I will become to her,” declares Jehovah, “a wall of fire all around, and I will become the glory in her midst.”’”</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">6  “Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares Jehovah.
“For I have scattered you to the four winds of the heavens,” declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">7  “Come, Zion! Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">8  For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after being glorified has sent me to the nations that were plundering you: ‘Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye.</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">9  For now I will wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own slaves.’ And you will certainly know that Jehovah of armies has sent me.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">10  “Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion; for I am coming, and I will reside in your midst,” declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">11  “Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and they will become my people; and I will reside in your midst.” And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you.</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">12  Jehovah will take possession of Judah as his portion on the holy ground, and he will again choose Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">13  Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah, for he is taking action from his holy dwelling.</span></p></level1>
