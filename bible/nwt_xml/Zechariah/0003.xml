<p><span id="p38" class="sentence">And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan was standing at his right hand to resist him.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">2  Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan: “May Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan, yes, may Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire?”</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">3  Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and standing before the angel.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">4  The angel said to those standing before him, “Remove his filthy garments.” Then he said to him, “See, I have caused your error to pass away from you, and you will be clothed with fine garments.”</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">5  So I said: “Let a clean turban be put on his head.” And they put the clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing nearby.</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">6  The angel of Jehovah then declared to Joshua:</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">7  “This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘If you will walk in my ways and carry out your responsibilities before me, then you will serve as a judge in my house and take care of my courtyards; and I will give you free access among these who are standing here.’</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">8  “‘Hear, please, O High Priest Joshua, you and your companions who sit before you, for these men serve as a sign; look! I am bringing in my servant Sprout!</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">9  See the stone that I have set before Joshua! On the one stone are seven eyes; and I am engraving an inscription on it,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘and I will take away the guilt of that land in one day.’</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">10  “‘In that day,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘each of you will invite your neighbor to come under your vine and under your fig tree.’”</span></p></level1>
