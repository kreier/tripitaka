<level1><h1 id="p130">Chapter 9</h1>
<p><span id="p131" class="sentence">A pronouncement:
“The word of Jehovah is against the land of Haʹdrach,And Damascus is its target—For Jehovah’s eye is on mankindAnd on all the tribes of Israel—</span>
<span id="p132" class="sentence">2  And against Haʹmath, which borders on her,And against Tyre and Siʹdon, for they are so wise.</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">3  Tyre built herself a rampart.
She piled up silver like dustAnd gold like the dirt of the streets.</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">4  Look! Jehovah will take away her possessions,And he will strike down her army into the sea;And she will be consumed in the fire.</span>
<span id="p135" class="sentence">5  Ashʹke·lon will see it and be afraid;Gazʹa will feel great anguish,Also Ekʹron, because her hope is put to shame.
A king will perish from Gazʹa,And Ashʹke·lon will not be inhabited.</span>
<span id="p136" class="sentence">6  An illegitimate son will settle in Ashʹdod,And I will do away with the pride of the Phi·lisʹtine.</span>
<span id="p137" class="sentence">7  I will remove the bloodstained things from his mouthAnd the disgusting things from between his teeth,And he will be left remaining for our God;And he will become like a sheikh in Judah,And Ekʹron like the Jebʹu·site.</span>
<span id="p138" class="sentence">8  I will encamp as a guard for my house,So that there will be no one passing through and no one returning;And no taskmaster will pass through again,For now I have seen it with my eyes.</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">9  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem.
Look! Your king is coming to you.
He is righteous, bringing salvation,Humble and riding on a donkey,On a colt, the foal of a female donkey.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">10  I will take away the war chariot from Eʹphra·imAnd the horse from Jerusalem.
The battle bow will be taken away.
And he will proclaim peace to the nations;His rulership will be from sea to seaAnd from the River to the ends of the earth.</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">11  As for you, O woman, by the blood of your covenant,I will send your prisoners out of the waterless pit.</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">12  Return to the stronghold, you prisoners with hope.
Today I am telling you,‘I will repay to you, O woman, a double portion.</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">13  For I will bend Judah as my bow.
The bow I will fill with Eʹphra·im,And I will awaken your sons, O Zion,Against your sons, O Greece,And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.’</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">14  Jehovah will be seen over them,And his arrow will go out like lightning.
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will sound the horn,And he will advance with the windstorms of the south.</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">15  Jehovah of armies will defend them,And they will devour and subdue the slingstones.
They will drink and be boisterous, as if with wine;And they will be filled like the bowl,Like the corners of the altar.</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">16  Jehovah their God will save them in that dayAs the flock of his people;For they will be like the gemstones of a crown glittering over his soil.</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">17  For how great his goodness is,And how great his handsomeness is!
Grain will make the young men thrive,And new wine the virgins.”</span></p></level1>
