<p><span id="p149" class="sentence">“Ask Jehovah for rain in the time of the spring rain.
It is Jehovah who makes the storm clouds,Who pours rain for them,And gives vegetation in the field to everyone.</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">2  For the teraphim statues have spoken deception;And the diviners have visioned a lie.
They speak about worthless dreams,And in vain they try to comfort.
That is why they will wander like sheep.
They will suffer, for there is no shepherd.</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">3  Against the shepherds my anger burns,And against the oppressive leaders I will hold an accounting;For Jehovah of armies has turned his attention to his flock, to the house of Judah,And he has made them like his majestic horse in the battle.</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">4  From him comes the keyman,From him comes the supporting ruler,From him comes the battle bow;From him goes forth every overseer, all of them together.</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">5  And they will become like warriors,Trampling down the mud of the streets in the battle.
They will wage war, for Jehovah is with them;And the riders of horses will be put to shame.</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">6  I will make the house of Judah superior,And the house of Joseph I will save.
I will restore them,For I will show them mercy;And they will be as though I had never cast them off;For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">7  Those of Eʹphra·im must become like a mighty warrior,And their heart will rejoice as though from wine.
Their sons will see this and rejoice;Their heart will be joyful in Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">8  ‘I will whistle for them and gather them together;For I will redeem them, and they will become many,And continue to be many.</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">9  Though I scatter them like seed among the peoples,They will remember me in the distant places;With their sons they will revive and return.</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">10  I will bring them back from the land of EgyptAnd gather them from As·syrʹi·a;I will bring them to the land of Gilʹe·ad and Lebʹa·non,And there will be no more room for them.</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">11  He must pass through the sea with distress;And in the sea he will strike down the waves;All the depths of the Nile will dry up.
The pride of As·syrʹi·a will be brought down,And the scepter of Egypt will depart.</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">12  I will make them superior in Jehovah,And they will walk about in his name,’ declares Jehovah.”</span></p></level1>
