<p><span id="p64" class="sentence">Again I looked up, and I saw a flying scroll.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">2  He asked me: “What do you see?”
I replied: “I see a flying scroll, which is 20 cubits long and 10 cubits wide.”</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">3  Then he said to me: “This is the curse that is going out over the face of all the earth, because everyone who steals, as written on its one side, has gone unpunished; and everyone who makes a sworn oath, as written on its other side, has gone unpunished.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">4  ‘I have sent it out,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘and it will enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one who makes a false oath in my name; and it will remain inside that house and consume it and its timbers and its stones.’”</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">5  Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said to me: “Look up, please, and see what is going out.”</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">6  So I asked: “What is it?”
He replied: “This is the eʹphah container that is going out.” He continued: “This is their appearance in all the earth.”</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">7  And I saw that the round lid of lead was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the container.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">8  So he said: “This is Wickedness.” Then he threw her back into the eʹphah container, after which he thrust the lead weight over its mouth.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">9  Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward, and they were soaring in the wind. They had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the container between the earth and heaven.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">10  So I asked the angel who was speaking with me: “Where are they taking the eʹphah container?”</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">11  He replied: “To the land of Shiʹnar to build her a house; and when it is prepared, she will be deposited there in her proper place.”</span></p></level1>
