<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">Simon Peter, a slave and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have acquired a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and the Savior Jesus Christ:</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  May undeserved kindness and peace be increased to you by an accurate knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  for his divine power has granted us all the things that contribute to life and godly devotion through the accurate knowledge of the One who called us by his own glory and virtue.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  Through these things he has granted us the precious and very grand promises, so that through these you may become sharers in divine nature, having escaped from the world’s corruption produced by wrong desire.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  For this very reason, put forth all earnest effort to supply to your faith virtue, to your virtue knowledge,</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  to your knowledge self-control, to your self-control endurance, to your endurance godly devotion,</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  to your godly devotion brotherly affection, to your brotherly affection love.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  For if these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  For anyone lacking these things is blind, shutting his eyes to the light, and has become forgetful of his cleansing from his sins of long ago.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and choosing sure for yourselves, for if you keep on doing these things, you will by no means ever fail.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  In fact, in this way you will be richly granted entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  For this reason I intend always to remind you of these things, although you know them and are well-established in the truth that is present in you.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you with reminders,</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  knowing as I do that my tabernacle is soon to be removed, just as also our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  I will always do my utmost so that after my departure, you may be able to recall these things for yourselves.</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  No, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but rather, we were eyewitnesses of his magnificence.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  For he received from God the Father honor and glory when words such as these were conveyed to him by the magnificent glory: “This is my Son, my beloved, whom I myself have approved.”</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  Yes, these words we heard coming from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  So we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place (until day dawns and a daystar rises) in your hearts.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  For you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.</span></p></level1>
