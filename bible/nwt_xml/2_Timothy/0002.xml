<level1><h1 id="p20">Chapter 2</h1>
<p><span id="p21" class="sentence">You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">2  and the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses, these things entrust to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">3  As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus, take your part in suffering adversity.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">4  No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">5  And even in the games, anyone who competes is not crowned unless he has competed according to the rules.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">6  The hardworking farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">7  Give constant thought to what I am saying; the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">8  Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up from the dead and was David’s offspring, according to the good news I preach,</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">9  for which I am suffering and being imprisoned as a criminal. Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">10  For this reason I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is through Christ Jesus, along with everlasting glory.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">11  This saying is trustworthy: Certainly if we died together, we will also live together;</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">12  if we go on enduring, we will also rule together as kings; if we deny, he will also deny us;</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">13  if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">14  Keep reminding them of these things, instructing them before God not to fight about words, something of no usefulness at all because it harms those listening.</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">15  Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">16  But reject empty speeches that violate what is holy, for they will lead to more and more ungodliness,</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">17  and their word will spread like gangrene. Hy·me·naeʹus and Phi·leʹtus are among them.</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">18  These men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are subverting the faith of some.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">19  Despite that, the solid foundation of God remains standing, having this seal, “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and, “Let everyone calling on the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.”</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">20  Now in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable use but others for a use lacking honor.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">21  So if anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be an instrument for an honorable use, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">22  So flee from youthful desires, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart.</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">23  Further, reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they produce fights.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">24  For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, showing restraint when wronged,</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">25  instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth,</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">26  and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him to do his will.</span></p></level1>
