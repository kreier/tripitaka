<p><span id="p48" class="sentence">But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">2  For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal,</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">3  having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness,</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">4  betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God,</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">5  having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">6  From among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires,</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">7  always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">8  Now in the way that Janʹnes and Jamʹbres opposed Moses, so these also go on opposing the truth. Such men are completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith.</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">9  Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their folly will be very plain to all, as it was with those two men.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">10  But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">11  the persecutions and sufferings such as I experienced in Antioch, in I·coʹni·um, in Lysʹtra. I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">12  In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">13  But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">14  You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from whom you learned them</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">15  and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">16  All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness,</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">17  so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.</span></p></level1>
