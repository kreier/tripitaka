<level1><h1 id="p65">Chapter 4</h1>
<p><span id="p66" class="sentence">I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his manifestation and his Kingdom:</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">2  Preach the word; be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times; reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all patience and art of teaching.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">3  For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">4  They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">5  You, though, keep your senses in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">6  For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my releasing is imminent.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">7  I have fought the fine fight, I have run the race to the finish, I have observed the faith.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">8  From this time on, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">9  Do your utmost to come to me shortly.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">10  For Deʹmas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things, and he has gone to Thes·sa·lo·niʹca, Cresʹcens to Ga·laʹti·a, Titus to Dal·maʹtia.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">11  Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark along with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">12  But I have sent Tychʹi·cus off to Ephʹe·sus.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">13  When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troʹas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">14  Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm. Jehovah will repay him according to his deeds.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">15  You too should be on guard against him, for he opposed our message to an excessive degree.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">16  In my first defense no one came to my side, but they all forsook me—may they not be held accountable.</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">17  But the Lord stood near me and infused power into me, so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it; and I was rescued from the lion’s mouth.</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">18  The Lord will rescue me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">19  Give my greetings to Prisʹca and Aqʹui·la and the household of On·e·siphʹo·rus.</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">20  E·rasʹtus stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophʹi·mus sick at Mi·leʹtus.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">21  Do your utmost to arrive before winter.
Eu·buʹlus sends you his greetings, and so do Puʹdens and Liʹnus and Clauʹdi·a and all the brothers.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">22  The Lord be with the spirit you show. His undeserved kindness be with you.</span></p></level1>
