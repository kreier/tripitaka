<p><span id="p31" class="sentence">Then the word of Jehovah came to Joʹnah a second time, saying:</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">2  “Get up, go to Ninʹe·veh the great city, and proclaim to her the message that I tell you.”</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">3  So Joʹnah got up and went to Ninʹe·veh in obedience to the word of Jehovah. Now Ninʹe·veh was a very large city—a walking distance of three days.</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">4  Then Joʹnah entered the city, and walking a day’s journey, he was proclaiming: “In just 40 days more, Ninʹe·veh will be overthrown.”</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">5  And the men of Ninʹe·veh put faith in God, and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">6  When the message reached the king of Ninʹe·veh, he rose up from his throne and took off his royal garment and covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the ashes.</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">7  Furthermore, he issued a proclamation throughout Ninʹe·veh,“By the decree of the king and his nobles: No man or beast, herd or flock, should eat anything at all. They should not take food, nor should they drink any water.</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">8  Let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast; and let them call out earnestly to God and turn from their evil ways and from the violence they practice.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">9  Who knows whether the true God may reconsider what he intends to do and turn from his burning anger, so that we may not perish?”</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">10  When the true God saw what they did, how they had turned back from their evil ways, he reconsidered the calamity that he said he would bring on them, and he did not bring it.</span></p></level1>
