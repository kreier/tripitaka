<p><span id="p20" class="sentence">Then Joʹnah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish,</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">2  and he said:
“Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he answered me.
Out of the depths of the Grave I cried for help.
You heard my voice.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">3  When you threw me to the depths, into the heart of the open sea,Then the currents engulfed me.
All your breakers and waves swept over me.</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">4  And I said, ‘I have been driven away from your sight!
How will I gaze again upon your holy temple?’</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">5  Waters engulfed me and threatened my life;The watery deep closed in on me.
Weeds were wrapped around my head.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">6  To the bottoms of the mountains I sank down.
The bars of the earth were closing upon me forever.
But out of the pit you brought up my life, O Jehovah my God.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">7  When my life was ebbing away, Jehovah was the One whom I remembered.
Then my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">8  Those who are devoted to the worthless idols forsake their source of loyal love.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">9  But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you.
What I have vowed, I will pay.
Salvation is from Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">10  In time Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited Joʹnah out onto the dry land.</span></p></level1>
