<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">In the third year of the kingship of King Je·hoiʹa·kim of Judah, King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  In time Jehovah gave King Je·hoiʹa·kim of Judah into his hand, along with some of the utensils of the house of the true God, and he brought them to the land of Shiʹnar to the house of his god. He placed the utensils in the treasury of his god.</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  Then the king ordered Ashʹpe·naz his chief court official to bring some of the Israelites, including those of royal and noble descent.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  They were to be youths without any defect, of good appearance, endowed with wisdom, knowledge, and discernment, and capable of serving in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the writing and the language of the Chal·deʹans.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  Furthermore, the king assigned to them a daily ration from the king’s delicacies and from the wine he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to enter the king’s service.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  Now among them were some from the tribe of Judah: Daniel, Han·a·niʹah, Mishʹa·el, and Az·a·riʹah.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  And the principal court official assigned names to them; he gave to Daniel the name Bel·te·shazʹzar, to Han·a·niʹah the name Shaʹdrach, to Mishʹa·el the name Meʹshach, and to Az·a·riʹah the name A·bedʹne·go.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies or with the wine he drank. So he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  And the true God caused the principal court official to show Daniel favor and mercy.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  But the principal court official said to Daniel: “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. What if he should see you looking worse in appearance than the other youths of your age? You would make me guilty before the king.”</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  But Daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official had appointed over Daniel, Han·a·niʹah, Mishʹa·el, and Az·a·riʹah:</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  “Please, test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink;</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  then compare our appearance with the appearance of the youths who are eating the king’s delicacies, and deal with your servants according to what you see.”</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  So he agreed to their proposal and tested them for ten days.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  At the end of ten days their appearance was better and healthier than all the youths who were eating the king’s delicacies.</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  So the guardian would take away their delicacies and their wine and give them vegetables.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  And the true God gave these four youths knowledge and insight into every kind of writing and wisdom; and Daniel was given understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  At the end of the time that the king had specified to bring them in, the principal court official brought them in before Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  When the king spoke with them, no one in the entire group was found to be like Daniel, Han·a·niʹah, Mishʹa·el, and Az·a·riʹah; and they continued to serve before the king.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  In every matter requiring wisdom and understanding that the king would ask them about, he found them ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests and the conjurers in his entire realm.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.</span></p></level1>
