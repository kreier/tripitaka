<p><span id="p84" class="sentence">“Where has your dear one gone,O most beautiful of women?
Which way did your dear one turn?
Let us seek him with you.”</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">2  “My dear one has gone down to his garden,To the beds of spice plants,To shepherd among the gardensAnd to pick lilies.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">3  I am my dear one’s,And my dear one is mine.
He is shepherding among the lilies.”</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">4  “You are as beautiful as Tirʹzah, my beloved,As lovely as Jerusalem,As breathtaking as armies around their banners.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">5  Turn your eyes away from me,For they overwhelm me.
Your hair is like a flock of goatsStreaming down the slopes of Gilʹe·ad.</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">6  Your teeth are like a flock of sheepThat have come up from being washed,All of them bearing twins,And not one has lost her young.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">7  Like a segment of pomegranateAre your cheeks behind your veil.</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">8  There may be 60 queensAnd 80 concubinesAnd young women without number.</span>
<span id="p92" class="sentence">9  But only one is my dove, my flawless one.
The only one of her mother.
She is the favorite of the one who bore her.
The daughters see her, and they pronounce her happy;Queens and concubines, and they praise her.</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">10  ‘Who is she who shines like the dawn,As beautiful as the full moon,As pure as the sunlight,As breathtaking as armies around their banners?’”</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">11  “I went down to the garden of nut treesTo see the new growth in the valley,To see whether the vine had sprouted,Whether the pomegranate trees had blossomed.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">12  Before I knew it,My desire had put meAt the chariots of my noble people.”</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">13  “Return, return, O Shuʹlam·mite!
Return, return,That we may look upon you!”
“Why do you gaze upon the Shuʹlam·mite?”
“She is like the dance of two companies!”</span></p></level1>
