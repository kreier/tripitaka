<p><span id="p38" class="sentence">“Upon my bed during the nights,I sought the one I love.
I sought him, but I did not find him.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">2  I will arise and roam the city;In the streets and in the public squares,Let me seek the one I love.
I sought him, but I did not find him.</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">3  The watchmen making their rounds in the city found me.
‘Have you seen the one I love?’</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">4  Scarcely had I passed by themWhen I found the one I love.
I held on to him, I would not let him goUntil I brought him into my mother’s house,Into the interior room of her who conceived me.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">5  I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,By the gazelles and the does of the field:
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.”</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">6  “What is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke,Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,With all the fragrant powders of a merchant?”</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">7  “Look! It is the couch belonging to Solʹo·mon.
Sixty mighty men surround it,Of the mighty men of Israel,</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">8  All of them armed with a sword,All trained in warfare,Each with his sword at his sideTo guard against the terrors of the night.”</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">9  “It is the royal litter of King Solʹo·monThat he made for himself from the trees of Lebʹa·non.</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">10  Its pillars he made of silver,Its supports of gold.
Its seat is of purple wool;Its interior was lovingly decoratedBy the daughters of Jerusalem.”</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">11  “Go out, O daughters of Zion,Gaze at King Solʹo·monWearing the wedding crown his mother made for himOn the day of his marriage,On the day of his heart’s rejoicing.”</span></p></level1>
