<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">The song of songs, which is Solʹo·mon’s:</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  “May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,For your expressions of affection are better than wine.</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  The fragrance of your oils is pleasant.
Your name is like a fragrant oil poured out.
That is why the young women love you.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  Take me with you; let us run.
The king has brought me into his interior rooms!
Let us be joyful and rejoice in you.
Let us praise your expressions of affection more than wine.
Rightly they love you.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  I am dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem,Like the tents of Keʹdar, like the tent cloths of Solʹo·mon.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  Do not stare at me because I am swarthy,Because the sun has gazed upon me.
The sons of my mother were angry with me;They appointed me the keeper of the vineyards,But my own vineyard I did not keep.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  Tell me, you whom I love so much,Where you pasture your flock,Where you have them lie down at midday.
Why should I be like a woman wrapped in a veilAmong the flocks of your companions?”</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  “If you do not know, O most beautiful of women,Go follow the tracks of the flockAnd pasture your young goats next to the tents of the shepherds.”</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  “I liken you, my beloved, to a mare among the chariots of Pharʹaoh.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,Your neck with strings of beads.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  We will make for you gold ornamentsStudded with silver.”</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  “While the king sits at his round table,My perfume gives off its fragrance.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  My dear one is to me like a fragrant bag of myrrhSpending the night between my breasts.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  My dear one is to me like a cluster of hennaAmong the vineyards of En-gedʹi.”</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  “Look! You are beautiful, my beloved.
Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are those of doves.”</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  “Look! You are beautiful, my dear one, and delightful.
Our bed is among the foliage.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  The beams of our house are cedars,Our rafters are juniper trees.</span></p></level1>
