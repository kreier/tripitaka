<level1><h1 id="p1339">Psalm 80 To the director; set to “The Lilies.” A reminder. Of Aʹsaph. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p1340" class="sentence">O Shepherd of Israel, listen,You who are guiding Joseph just like a flock.
You who sit enthroned above the cherubs,Shine forth.</span>
<span id="p1341" class="sentence">2  Before Eʹphra·im and Benjamin and Ma·nasʹseh,Do stir up your mightiness;Come and save us.</span>
<span id="p1342" class="sentence">3  O God, restore us;Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved.</span>
<span id="p1343" class="sentence">4  Jehovah God of armies, how long will you be hostile toward the prayer of your people?</span>
<span id="p1344" class="sentence">5  You feed them tears as their bread,And you make them drink tears beyond measure.</span>
<span id="p1345" class="sentence">6  You let our neighbors quarrel over us;Our enemies keep mocking us as they please.</span>
<span id="p1346" class="sentence">7  O God of armies, restore us;Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved.</span>
<span id="p1347" class="sentence">8  You made a vine depart from Egypt.
You drove out the nations and planted it.</span>
<span id="p1348" class="sentence">9  You cleared a space for it,And it took root and filled the land.</span>
<span id="p1349" class="sentence">10  The mountains were covered by its shadow,And the cedars of God by its branches.</span>
<span id="p1350" class="sentence">11  Its branches reached as far as the sea,And its shoots to the River.</span>
<span id="p1351" class="sentence">12  Why have you broken down the stone walls of the vineyard,So that all those passing by pluck its fruit?</span>
<span id="p1352" class="sentence">13  The boars of the forest ravage it,And the wild animals of the field feed on it.</span>
<span id="p1353" class="sentence">14  O God of armies, please return.
Look down from heaven and see!
Take care of this vine,</span>
<span id="p1354" class="sentence">15  The stock that your right hand has planted,And look upon the son whom you made strong for yourself.</span>
<span id="p1355" class="sentence">16  It is burned with fire, cut down.
They perish at your rebuke.</span>
<span id="p1356" class="sentence">17  May your hand give support to the man at your right hand,To the son of man you have made strong for yourself.</span>
<span id="p1357" class="sentence">18  Then we will not turn away from you.
Preserve us alive, so that we may call on your name.</span>
<span id="p1358" class="sentence">19  O Jehovah God of armies, restore us;Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved.</span></p></level1>
