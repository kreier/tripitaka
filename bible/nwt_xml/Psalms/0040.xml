<level1><h1 id="p626">Psalm 40 To the director. Of David. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p627" class="sentence">I earnestly hoped in Jehovah,And he inclined his ear to me and heard my cry for help.</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">2  He brought me up out of a roaring pit,Out of the slimy mire.
And he set my feet upon a crag;He made my footing secure.</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">3  Then he put a new song in my mouth,Praise to our God.
Many will look on in aweAnd put their trust in Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">4  Happy is the man who trusts in JehovahAnd who does not look to the defiant or to those who are false.</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">5  How many things you have done,O Jehovah my God,Your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us.
None can compare to you;If I were to try to tell and speak of them,They would be too numerous to recount!</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">6  Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,But you opened up my ears to hear.
You did not ask for burnt offerings and sin offerings.</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">7  Then I said: “Look, I have come.
In the scroll it is written about me.</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">8  To do your will, O my God, is my delight,And your law is deep within me.</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">9  I proclaim the good news of righteousness in the great congregation.
Look! I do not restrain my lips,O Jehovah, as you well know.</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">10  I do not cover over your righteousness in my heart.
I declare your faithfulness and salvation.
I do not hide your loyal love and your truth in the great congregation.”</span>
<span id="p637" class="sentence">11  O Jehovah, do not withhold your mercy from me.
May your loyal love and your truth constantly safeguard me.</span>
<span id="p638" class="sentence">12  The calamities surrounding me are too many to count.
So many of my errors overwhelm me that I cannot see my way;They are more numerous than the hairs of my head,And I have lost heart.</span>
<span id="p639" class="sentence">13  Please be willing, O Jehovah, to save me.
O Jehovah, hurry to help me.</span>
<span id="p640" class="sentence">14  May all those seeking to take my lifeBe put to shame and disgraced.
May those who delight in my calamityRetreat in humiliation.</span>
<span id="p641" class="sentence">15  May those who are saying to me: “Aha! Aha!”
Be appalled because of their own shame.</span>
<span id="p642" class="sentence">16  But let those seeking youExult and rejoice in you.
May those who love your acts of salvation always say:
“May Jehovah be magnified.”</span>
<span id="p643" class="sentence">17  But I am helpless and poor;May Jehovah pay attention to me.
You are my helper and my rescuer;My God, do not delay.</span></p></level1>
