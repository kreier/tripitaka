<p><span id="p2560" class="sentence">Praise Jah!
It is good to sing praises to our God;How pleasant and fitting it is to praise him!</span>
<span id="p2561" class="sentence">2  Jehovah is building Jerusalem;He gathers together the dispersed ones of Israel.</span>
<span id="p2562" class="sentence">3  He heals the brokenhearted;He binds up their wounds.</span>
<span id="p2563" class="sentence">4  He counts the number of the stars;He calls all of them by name.</span>
<span id="p2564" class="sentence">5  Our Lord is great and is mighty in power;His understanding is beyond measure.</span>
<span id="p2565" class="sentence">6  Jehovah raises up the meek,But he hurls the wicked to the ground.</span>
<span id="p2566" class="sentence">7  Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving;Sing praises to our God, accompanied by the harp,</span>
<span id="p2567" class="sentence">8  The One who covers the heavens with clouds,The One providing rain for the earth,The One making grass sprout on the mountains.</span>
<span id="p2568" class="sentence">9  To the animals he gives food,To the young ravens that call out for it.</span>
<span id="p2569" class="sentence">10  He does not delight in the power of the horse;Nor is he impressed by the strong legs of a man.</span>
<span id="p2570" class="sentence">11  Jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him,In those waiting for his loyal love.</span>
<span id="p2571" class="sentence">12  Glorify Jehovah, O Jerusalem.
Praise your God, O Zion.</span>
<span id="p2572" class="sentence">13  He makes the bars of your city gates strong;He blesses your sons within you.</span>
<span id="p2573" class="sentence">14  He brings peace to your territory;He satisfies you with the finest wheat.</span>
<span id="p2574" class="sentence">15  He sends his command to the earth;His word runs swiftly.</span>
<span id="p2575" class="sentence">16  He sends the snow like wool;He scatters the frost just like ashes.</span>
<span id="p2576" class="sentence">17  He hurls down his hailstones like morsels of bread.
Who can withstand his cold?</span>
<span id="p2577" class="sentence">18  He sends out his word, and they melt.
He makes his wind blow, and the waters flow.</span>
<span id="p2578" class="sentence">19  He declares his word to Jacob,His regulations and judgments to Israel.</span>
<span id="p2579" class="sentence">20  He has not done so with any other nation;They know nothing about his judgments.
Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
