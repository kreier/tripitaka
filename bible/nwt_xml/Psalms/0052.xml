<level1><h1 id="p823">Psalm 52 To the director. Masʹkil. Of David, when Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite came and told Saul that David had come to the house of A·himʹe·lech.</h1>
<p><span id="p824" class="sentence">Why do you boast about your evil acts, you mighty one?
The loyal love of God lasts all day long.</span>
<span id="p825" class="sentence">2  Your tongue, as sharp as a razor,Schemes harm and works deceitfully.</span>
<span id="p826" class="sentence">3  You love evil more than what is good,Lying more than speaking what is right. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p827" class="sentence">4  You love every harmful word,O you deceitful tongue!</span>
<span id="p828" class="sentence">5  That is why God will pull you down once and for all;He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent;He will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p829" class="sentence">6  The righteous ones will see it and be filled with awe,And they will laugh at him.</span>
<span id="p830" class="sentence">7  “Here is a man who did not make God his refuge,But he trusted in his great richesAnd relied on his own evil plots.”</span>
<span id="p831" class="sentence">8  But I will be like a luxuriant olive tree in God’s house;My trust is in God’s loyal love, forever and ever.</span>
<span id="p832" class="sentence">9  I will praise you forever because you have taken action;In the presence of your loyal ones,I will hope in your name, for it is good.</span></p></level1>
