<level1><h1 id="p676">Psalm 44 To the director. Of the sons of Korʹah. Masʹkil.</h1>
<p><span id="p677" class="sentence">O God, we have heard with our own ears,Our forefathers have recounted to us,The deeds you accomplished in their days,In the days of long ago.</span>
<span id="p678" class="sentence">2  With your hand you drove away nationsAnd settled our forefathers there.
You crushed nations and drove them out.</span>
<span id="p679" class="sentence">3  It was not by their own sword that they took possession of the land,And their own arm did not bring them victory.
Rather, it was by your right hand and your arm and the light of your face,For you took pleasure in them.</span>
<span id="p680" class="sentence">4  You are my King, O God;Command complete victory for Jacob.</span>
<span id="p681" class="sentence">5  By your power we will drive back our adversaries;In your name we will trample down those who rise up against us.</span>
<span id="p682" class="sentence">6  For I do not trust in my bow,And my sword cannot save me.</span>
<span id="p683" class="sentence">7  It was you who saved us from our adversaries,You who humiliated those who hate us.</span>
<span id="p684" class="sentence">8  To God we will offer praise all day long,And we will give thanks to your name forever. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p685" class="sentence">9  But now you have cast us off and humiliated us,And you do not go out with our armies.</span>
<span id="p686" class="sentence">10  You keep making us retreat from our adversary;Those who hate us take whatever they want.</span>
<span id="p687" class="sentence">11  You hand us over to be devoured like sheep;You have scattered us among the nations.</span>
<span id="p688" class="sentence">12  You sell your people for next to nothing;You make no profit from the sale.</span>
<span id="p689" class="sentence">13  You make us a reproach to our neighbors,An object of ridicule and jeering to those all around us.</span>
<span id="p690" class="sentence">14  You make us an object of scorn among the nations,Something for the peoples to shake their heads at.</span>
<span id="p691" class="sentence">15  I feel humiliated all day long,And I am overwhelmed by my shame,</span>
<span id="p692" class="sentence">16  On account of the sound of their taunts and insults,Because of our enemy who is taking revenge.</span>
<span id="p693" class="sentence">17  All of this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you,And we have not violated your covenant.</span>
<span id="p694" class="sentence">18  Our heart has not deviated;Our footsteps do not stray from your path.</span>
<span id="p695" class="sentence">19  But you have crushed us where the jackals dwell;You have covered us with deep shadow.</span>
<span id="p696" class="sentence">20  If we have forgotten the name of our GodOr if we spread out our hands in prayer to a foreign god,</span>
<span id="p697" class="sentence">21  Will not God discover this?
He is aware of the secrets of the heart.</span>
<span id="p698" class="sentence">22  For your sake we are being put to death all day long;We have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.</span>
<span id="p699" class="sentence">23  Rouse yourself. Why do you keep sleeping, O Jehovah?
Awake! Do not keep casting us off forever.</span>
<span id="p700" class="sentence">24  Why do you hide your face?
Why do you forget our affliction and our oppression?</span>
<span id="p701" class="sentence">25  For we have been brought down to the dust;Our bodies are pressed to the ground.</span>
<span id="p702" class="sentence">26  Rise up as our helper!
Rescue us because of your loyal love.</span></p></level1>
