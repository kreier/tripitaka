<level1><h1 id="p2510">Psalm 144 Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p2511" class="sentence">May Jehovah, my Rock, be praised,Who trains my hands for battle,My fingers for warfare.</span>
<span id="p2512" class="sentence">2  He is my loyal love and my stronghold,My secure refuge and my rescuer,My shield and the One in whom I have taken shelter,The One subduing peoples under me.</span>
<span id="p2513" class="sentence">3  O Jehovah, what is man that you should notice him,The son of mortal man that you should pay attention to him?</span>
<span id="p2514" class="sentence">4  Man resembles a mere breath;His days are like a passing shadow.</span>
<span id="p2515" class="sentence">5  O Jehovah, lower your heavens and descend;Touch the mountains and make them smoke.</span>
<span id="p2516" class="sentence">6  Make lightning flash and scatter the enemy;Shoot your arrows and throw them into confusion.</span>
<span id="p2517" class="sentence">7  Stretch out your hands from above;Rescue me and save me from the surging waters,From the hand of the foreigners,</span>
<span id="p2518" class="sentence">8  Whose mouths speak liesAnd who raise their right hand to swear to what is false.</span>
<span id="p2519" class="sentence">9  O God, I will sing to you a new song.
I will sing praises to you, accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument,</span>
<span id="p2520" class="sentence">10  To the One who gives victory to kings,The One rescuing his servant David from the deadly sword.</span>
<span id="p2521" class="sentence">11  Rescue me and save me from the hand of the foreigners,Whose mouths speak liesAnd who raise their right hand to swear to what is false.</span>
<span id="p2522" class="sentence">12  Then our sons will be like young plants that grow up quickly,Our daughters like corner pillars carved for a palace.</span>
<span id="p2523" class="sentence">13  Our storehouses will overflow with every kind of produce;Our flocks in our fields will multiply by the thousands, by the tens of thousands.</span>
<span id="p2524" class="sentence">14  Our cattle, heavy with young, will suffer no mishap or miscarriage;There will be no cry of distress in our public squares.</span>
<span id="p2525" class="sentence">15  Happy is the people for whom it is this way!
Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!</span></p></level1>
