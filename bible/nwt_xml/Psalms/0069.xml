<level1><h1 id="p1065">Psalm 69 To the director; set to “The Lilies.” Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p1066" class="sentence">Save me, O God, for the waters threaten my life.</span>
<span id="p1067" class="sentence">2  I have sunk down into the deep mud, where there is no solid ground.
I have come into deep waters,And the rushing stream has swept me away.</span>
<span id="p1068" class="sentence">3  I am exhausted from calling out;My throat has become hoarse.
My eyes have grown weary while waiting for my God.</span>
<span id="p1069" class="sentence">4  Those hating me without causeAre more numerous than the hairs of my head.
Those who would do away with me,My treacherous enemies, have become many.
I was forced to hand over what I had not stolen.</span>
<span id="p1070" class="sentence">5  O God, you are aware of my foolishness,And my guilt is not hidden from you.</span>
<span id="p1071" class="sentence">6  May those hoping in you not be put to shame because of me,O Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.
May those seeking you not be humiliated because of me,O God of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1072" class="sentence">7  I suffer reproach on your account;Humiliation covers my face.</span>
<span id="p1073" class="sentence">8  I have become a stranger to my brothers,A foreigner to the sons of my mother.</span>
<span id="p1074" class="sentence">9  Zeal for your house has consumed me,And the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me.</span>
<span id="p1075" class="sentence">10  When I humbled myself with fasting,I was reproached for it.</span>
<span id="p1076" class="sentence">11  When I made sackcloth my clothing,I became an object of scorn to them.</span>
<span id="p1077" class="sentence">12  I am the talk of those sitting in the city gate,And the drunkards make me the subject of their songs.</span>
<span id="p1078" class="sentence">13  But may my prayer come to you,O Jehovah, at an acceptable time.
In your abundant loyal love, O God,Answer me with your sure acts of salvation.</span>
<span id="p1079" class="sentence">14  Rescue me from the mire;Do not let me sink down.
Rescue me from those who hate meAnd from the deep waters.</span>
<span id="p1080" class="sentence">15  Do not let the rushing floodwaters sweep me away,Or let the deep swallow me,Or let the well close its mouth over me.</span>
<span id="p1081" class="sentence">16  Answer me, O Jehovah, for your loyal love is good.
According to your abundant mercy turn toward me,</span>
<span id="p1082" class="sentence">17  And do not hide your face from your servant.
Answer me quickly, for I am in distress.</span>
<span id="p1083" class="sentence">18  Come near to me and rescue me;Redeem me on account of my enemies.</span>
<span id="p1084" class="sentence">19  You know my reproach and my disgrace and my humiliation.
You see all my foes.</span>
<span id="p1085" class="sentence">20  Reproach has broken my heart, and the wound is incurable.
I was hoping for sympathy, but there was none,And for comforters, but I found none.</span>
<span id="p1086" class="sentence">21  But for food they gave me poison,And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span>
<span id="p1087" class="sentence">22  Let their table become a trap for them,And their prosperity, a snare.</span>
<span id="p1088" class="sentence">23  Let their eyes become darkened so that they cannot see,And make their hips tremble constantly.</span>
<span id="p1089" class="sentence">24  Pour out upon them your indignation,And may your burning anger overtake them.</span>
<span id="p1090" class="sentence">25  Let their encampment become desolate;Let there be no inhabitant in their tents.</span>
<span id="p1091" class="sentence">26  For they pursue the one whom you struck,And they keep recounting the pains of those you wounded.</span>
<span id="p1092" class="sentence">27  Add more guilt to their guilt,And may they have no share in your righteousness.</span>
<span id="p1093" class="sentence">28  Let them be erased from the book of the living,And may they not be enrolled among the righteous.</span>
<span id="p1094" class="sentence">29  But I am afflicted and in pain.
May your saving power, O God, protect me.</span>
<span id="p1095" class="sentence">30  I will sing praises to the name of God,And I will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span>
<span id="p1096" class="sentence">31  This will please Jehovah more than a bull,More than a young bull with horns and hooves.</span>
<span id="p1097" class="sentence">32  The meek will see it and rejoice.
You who are seeking God, may your hearts revive.</span>
<span id="p1098" class="sentence">33  For Jehovah is listening to the poor,And he will not despise his captive people.</span>
<span id="p1099" class="sentence">34  Let heaven and earth praise him,The seas and everything that moves in them.</span>
<span id="p1100" class="sentence">35  For God will save ZionAnd will rebuild the cities of Judah,And they will dwell there and possess it.</span>
<span id="p1101" class="sentence">36  The descendants of his servants will inherit it,And those who love his name will reside in it.</span></p></level1>
