<level1><h1 id="p2478">Psalm 141 A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p2479" class="sentence">O Jehovah, I call on you.
Come quickly to help me.
Do pay attention when I call to you.</span>
<span id="p2480" class="sentence">2  May my prayer be as incense prepared before you,My uplifted hands like the evening grain offering.</span>
<span id="p2481" class="sentence">3  Station a guard for my mouth, O Jehovah,Do set a watch over the door of my lips.</span>
<span id="p2482" class="sentence">4  Do not let my heart incline to anything bad,To share in vile deeds with evil men;May I never feast on their delicacies.</span>
<span id="p2483" class="sentence">5  Should the righteous one strike me, it would be an act of loyal love;Should he reprove me, it would be like oil on my head,Which my head would never refuse.
My prayer will continue even during their calamities.</span>
<span id="p2484" class="sentence">6  Though their judges are thrown down from the cliff,The people will pay attention to my words, for they are pleasant.</span>
<span id="p2485" class="sentence">7  Just as when someone plows and breaks up the soil,So our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the Grave.</span>
<span id="p2486" class="sentence">8  But my eyes look to you, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.
In you I have taken refuge.
Do not take away my life.</span>
<span id="p2487" class="sentence">9  Protect me from the jaws of the trap they have laid for me,From the snares of evildoers.</span>
<span id="p2488" class="sentence">10  The wicked will fall into their own nets all togetherWhile I pass by safely.</span></p></level1>
