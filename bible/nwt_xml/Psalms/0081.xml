<level1><h1 id="p1359">Psalm 81 To the director; upon the Gitʹtith. Of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p1360" class="sentence">Shout joyfully to God our strength.
Shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.</span>
<span id="p1361" class="sentence">2  Begin the music and take a tambourine,The melodious harp together with the stringed instrument.</span>
<span id="p1362" class="sentence">3  Blow the horn on the new moon,On the full moon, for the day of our festival.</span>
<span id="p1363" class="sentence">4  For it is a decree for Israel,A ruling of the God of Jacob.</span>
<span id="p1364" class="sentence">5  He established it as a reminder for JosephWhen He went out against the land of Egypt.
I heard a voice that I did not recognize:</span>
<span id="p1365" class="sentence">6  “I lifted the burden from his shoulder;His hands were freed from the basket.</span>
<span id="p1366" class="sentence">7  In your distress you called, and I rescued you;I answered you from the thundercloud.
I tested you at the waters of Merʹi·bah. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1367" class="sentence">8  Hear, my people, and I will testify against you.
O Israel, if you would only listen to me.</span>
<span id="p1368" class="sentence">9  Among you, there will be no strange god,And you will not bow down to a foreign god.</span>
<span id="p1369" class="sentence">10  I, Jehovah, am your God,The one who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</span>
<span id="p1370" class="sentence">11  But my people did not listen to my voice;Israel would not submit to me.</span>
<span id="p1371" class="sentence">12  So I let them follow their stubborn hearts;They did what they thought was right.</span>
<span id="p1372" class="sentence">13  If only my people would listen to me,If only Israel would walk in my ways!</span>
<span id="p1373" class="sentence">14  Their enemies I would quickly subdue;I would turn my hand against their adversaries.</span>
<span id="p1374" class="sentence">15  Those who hate Jehovah will cringe in his presence,And their outcome will be forever.</span>
<span id="p1375" class="sentence">16  But he will feed you with the finest wheatAnd satisfy you with honey from the rock.”</span></p></level1>
