<level1><h1 id="p423">Psalm 31 To the director. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p424" class="sentence">In you, O Jehovah, I have taken refuge.
May I never be put to shame.
Rescue me because of your righteousness.</span>
<span id="p425" class="sentence">2  Incline your ear to me.
Come quickly to my rescue.
Become for me a mountain stronghold,A fortified place to save me.</span>
<span id="p426" class="sentence">3  For you are my crag and my stronghold;For the sake of your name, you will lead me and guide me.</span>
<span id="p427" class="sentence">4  You will free me from the net that they have secretly laid for me,For you are my fortress.</span>
<span id="p428" class="sentence">5  Into your hand I entrust my spirit.
You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, the God of truth.</span>
<span id="p429" class="sentence">6  I hate those who are devoted to worthless, vain idols,But as for me, I trust in Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p430" class="sentence">7  I will rejoice greatly in your loyal love,For you have seen my affliction;You are aware of my deep distress.</span>
<span id="p431" class="sentence">8  You have not handed me over to the enemy,But you make me stand in a place of safety.</span>
<span id="p432" class="sentence">9  Show me favor, O Jehovah, for I am in distress.
Anguish has made my eyes weak, my whole body as well.</span>
<span id="p433" class="sentence">10  My life is consumed with griefAnd my years with groaning.
My strength is waning because of my error;My bones grow weak.</span>
<span id="p434" class="sentence">11  I am scorned by all my adversaries,Especially my neighbors.
And I am dreaded by my acquaintances;When they see me in public, they flee from me.</span>
<span id="p435" class="sentence">12  I am put out of their heart and forgotten, as if I were dead;I am like a broken jar.</span>
<span id="p436" class="sentence">13  I have heard many evil rumors;Terror surrounds me.
When they gather together as one against me,They scheme to take away my life.</span>
<span id="p437" class="sentence">14  But I trust in you, O Jehovah.
I declare: “You are my God.”</span>
<span id="p438" class="sentence">15  My days are in your hand.
Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me.</span>
<span id="p439" class="sentence">16  Make your face shine upon your servant.
Save me by your loyal love.</span>
<span id="p440" class="sentence">17  O Jehovah, may I not be put to shame when I call on you.
May the wicked be put to shame;May they be silenced in the Grave.</span>
<span id="p441" class="sentence">18  May lying lips become speechless,Lips that speak arrogantly against the righteous, with haughtiness and contempt.</span>
<span id="p442" class="sentence">19  How abundant your goodness is!
You have stored it up for those who fear you,And you have shown it before all men, in behalf of those taking refuge in you.</span>
<span id="p443" class="sentence">20  You will conceal them in the secret place of your presenceFrom the schemes of men;You will hide them in your shelterFrom malicious attacks.</span>
<span id="p444" class="sentence">21  May Jehovah be praised,For in a wonderful way, he has shown his loyal love to me in a besieged city.</span>
<span id="p445" class="sentence">22  As for me, I panicked and said:
“I will perish from before you.”
But you heard my pleas for help when I cried out to you.</span>
<span id="p446" class="sentence">23  Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!
Jehovah protects the faithful,But he repays exceedingly anyone showing haughtiness.</span>
<span id="p447" class="sentence">24  Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,All you who are waiting for Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
