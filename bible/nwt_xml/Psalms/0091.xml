<level1><h1 id="p1547">Psalm 91</h1>
<p><span id="p1548" class="sentence">Anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most HighWill lodge under the shadow of the Almighty.</span>
<span id="p1549" class="sentence">2  I will say to Jehovah: “You are my refuge and my stronghold,My God in whom I trust.”</span>
<span id="p1550" class="sentence">3  For he will rescue you from the trap of the birdcatcher,From the destructive pestilence.</span>
<span id="p1551" class="sentence">4  With his pinions he will cover you,And under his wings you will take refuge.
His faithfulness will be a large shield and a protective wall.</span>
<span id="p1552" class="sentence">5  You will not fear the terrors of the night,Nor the arrow that flies by day,</span>
<span id="p1553" class="sentence">6  Nor the pestilence that stalks in the gloom,Nor the destruction that ravages at midday.</span>
<span id="p1554" class="sentence">7  A thousand will fall at your sideAnd ten thousand at your right hand,But to you it will not come near.</span>
<span id="p1555" class="sentence">8  You will only see it with your eyesAs you witness the punishment of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p1556" class="sentence">9  Because you said: “Jehovah is my refuge,”
You have made the Most High your dwelling;</span>
<span id="p1557" class="sentence">10  No disaster will befall you,And no plague will come near your tent.</span>
<span id="p1558" class="sentence">11  For he will give his angels a command concerning you,To guard you in all your ways.</span>
<span id="p1559" class="sentence">12  They will carry you on their hands,So that you may not strike your foot against a stone.</span>
<span id="p1560" class="sentence">13  On the young lion and the cobra you will tread;You will trample underfoot the maned lion and the big snake.</span>
<span id="p1561" class="sentence">14  God said: “Because he has affection for me, I will rescue him.
I will protect him because he knows my name.</span>
<span id="p1562" class="sentence">15  He will call on me, and I will answer him.
I will be with him in distress.
I will rescue him and glorify him.</span>
<span id="p1563" class="sentence">16  I will satisfy him with long life,And I will cause him to see my acts of salvation.”</span></p></level1>
