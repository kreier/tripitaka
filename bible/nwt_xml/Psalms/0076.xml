<level1><h1 id="p1218">Psalm 76 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. A melody of Aʹsaph. A song.</h1>
<p><span id="p1219" class="sentence">God is known in Judah;In Israel his name is great.</span>
<span id="p1220" class="sentence">2  His shelter is in Saʹlem,And his dwelling is in Zion.</span>
<span id="p1221" class="sentence">3  There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1222" class="sentence">4  You shine brightly;You are more majestic than the mountains of prey.</span>
<span id="p1223" class="sentence">5  The courageous of heart have been plundered.
They have fallen asleep;The warriors were all helpless.</span>
<span id="p1224" class="sentence">6  From your rebuke, O God of Jacob,Both the charioteer and the horse have fallen fast asleep.</span>
<span id="p1225" class="sentence">7  You alone are awe-inspiring.
Who can withstand your intense anger?</span>
<span id="p1226" class="sentence">8  From heaven you pronounced judgment;The earth was afraid and was silent</span>
<span id="p1227" class="sentence">9  When God rose up to execute judgment,To save all the meek of the earth. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1228" class="sentence">10  For the rage of man will serve to your praise;With the remnants of their rage you will adorn yourself.</span>
<span id="p1229" class="sentence">11  Make your vows to Jehovah your God and pay them,Let all who are around him bring their gift in fear.</span>
<span id="p1230" class="sentence">12  He will humble the pride of leaders;He inspires fear in the kings of the earth.</span></p></level1>
