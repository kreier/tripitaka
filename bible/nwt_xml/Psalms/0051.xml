<level1><h1 id="p803">Psalm 51 To the director. A melody of David, when Nathan the prophet came in to him after David had relations with Bath-sheʹba.</h1>
<p><span id="p804" class="sentence">Show me favor, O God, according to your loyal love.
Blot out my transgressions according to your great mercy.</span>
<span id="p805" class="sentence">2  Thoroughly wash me from my error,And cleanse me from my sin.</span>
<span id="p806" class="sentence">3  For I am well-aware of my transgressions,And my sin is always before me.</span>
<span id="p807" class="sentence">4  Against you—you above all—I have sinned;What is bad in your eyes I have done.
Therefore, you are righteous when you speak,You are right in your judgment.</span>
<span id="p808" class="sentence">5  Look! I was born guilty of error,And my mother conceived me in sin.</span>
<span id="p809" class="sentence">6  Look! You find pleasure in truth in the inner person;Teach my innermost self true wisdom.</span>
<span id="p810" class="sentence">7  Purify me from my sin with hyssop, so that I will be clean;Wash me, so that I will be whiter than snow.</span>
<span id="p811" class="sentence">8  Let me hear sounds of joy and rejoicing,So that the bones you crushed will rejoice.</span>
<span id="p812" class="sentence">9  Turn your face away from my sins,And wipe away all my errors.</span>
<span id="p813" class="sentence">10  Create in me a pure heart, O God,And put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.</span>
<span id="p814" class="sentence">11  Do not cast me out from your presence;And do not take your holy spirit away from me.</span>
<span id="p815" class="sentence">12  Restore to me the joy of your salvation;Stir within me a willingness to obey you.</span>
<span id="p816" class="sentence">13  I will teach transgressors your ways,So that sinners will return to you.</span>
<span id="p817" class="sentence">14  Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation,So that my tongue may joyfully declare your righteousness.</span>
<span id="p818" class="sentence">15  O Jehovah, open my lips,So that my mouth may declare your praise.</span>
<span id="p819" class="sentence">16  For you do not want a sacrifice—otherwise I would give it;You do not find delight in a whole burnt offering.</span>
<span id="p820" class="sentence">17  The sacrifices pleasing to God are a broken spirit;A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.</span>
<span id="p821" class="sentence">18  In your goodwill do what is good for Zion;Build up the walls of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p822" class="sentence">19  Then you will take delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,The burnt sacrifices and the whole offerings;Then bulls will be offered up on your altar.</span></p></level1>
