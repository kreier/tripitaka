<p><span id="p590" class="sentence">O Jehovah, do not reprove me in your anger,Nor correct me in your wrath.</span>
<span id="p591" class="sentence">2  For your arrows have pierced deep into me,And your hand presses down on me.</span>
<span id="p592" class="sentence">3  My whole body is sick because of your indignation.
There is no peace within my bones because of my sin.</span>
<span id="p593" class="sentence">4  For my errors loom over my head;Like a heavy burden, they are too much for me to bear.</span>
<span id="p594" class="sentence">5  My wounds stink and festerBecause of my foolishness.</span>
<span id="p595" class="sentence">6  I am distressed and extremely downcast;I walk around sad all day long.</span>
<span id="p596" class="sentence">7  There is a burning within me;My whole body is sick.</span>
<span id="p597" class="sentence">8  I have grown numb and become completely crushed;My anguished heart makes me groan aloud.</span>
<span id="p598" class="sentence">9  O Jehovah, all my desires are before you,And my sighing is not hidden from you.</span>
<span id="p599" class="sentence">10  My heart pounds, my strength is gone,And the light of my eyes has left me.</span>
<span id="p600" class="sentence">11  My friends and my companions avoid me because of my plague,And my close acquaintances keep their distance.</span>
<span id="p601" class="sentence">12  Those seeking my life set traps;Those trying to harm me speak of ruin;They mutter deception all day long.</span>
<span id="p602" class="sentence">13  But like someone deaf, I would not listen;Like someone speechless, I would not open my mouth.</span>
<span id="p603" class="sentence">14  I have become like a man who cannot hear,Whose mouth has nothing to say in defense.</span>
<span id="p604" class="sentence">15  For on you, O Jehovah, I waited,And you answered me, O Jehovah my God.</span>
<span id="p605" class="sentence">16  For I said: “May they not gloat over meOr exalt themselves over me if my foot slips.”</span>
<span id="p606" class="sentence">17  For I was ready to collapse,And my pain was always with me.</span>
<span id="p607" class="sentence">18  I confessed my error;I was troubled by my sin.</span>
<span id="p608" class="sentence">19  But my enemies are vigorous and mighty,Those hating me for no reason have become numerous.</span>
<span id="p609" class="sentence">20  They repaid me with bad for good;They were resisting me for pursuing what is good.</span>
<span id="p610" class="sentence">21  Do not abandon me, O Jehovah.
O God, do not remain far away from me.</span>
<span id="p611" class="sentence">22  Do hurry to help me,O Jehovah, my salvation.</span></p></level1>
