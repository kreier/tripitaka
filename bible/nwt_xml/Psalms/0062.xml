<p><span id="p951" class="sentence">Indeed, I wait silently for God.
My salvation comes from him.</span>
<span id="p952" class="sentence">2  Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge;I will never be greatly shaken.</span>
<span id="p953" class="sentence">3  How long will you assault a man in order to murder him?
All of you are as dangerous as a leaning wall, a stone wall ready to collapse.</span>
<span id="p954" class="sentence">4  For they consult together to topple him from his high position;They take pleasure in lying.
With their mouth they bless, but inside they are cursing. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p955" class="sentence">5  Indeed, I wait silently for GodBecause my hope comes from him.</span>
<span id="p956" class="sentence">6  Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge;I will never be shaken.</span>
<span id="p957" class="sentence">7  Upon God depends my salvation and my glory.
My strong rock, my refuge, is God.</span>
<span id="p958" class="sentence">8  Trust in him at all times, O people.
Pour out your hearts before him.
God is a refuge for us. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p959" class="sentence">9  The sons of men are a mere breath,The sons of mankind are a delusion.
When laid together on the scales, they are lighter than a mere breath.</span>
<span id="p960" class="sentence">10  Do not trust in extortionOr put false hopes in robbery.
If your wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.</span>
<span id="p961" class="sentence">11  Once God has spoken, twice I have heard this:
That strength belongs to God.</span>
<span id="p962" class="sentence">12  Also loyal love is yours, O Jehovah,For you repay each one according to his deeds.</span></p></level1>
