<level1><h1 id="p612">Psalm 39 To the director; of Je·duʹthun. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p613" class="sentence">I said: “I will guard my stepTo avoid sinning with my tongue.
I will guard my mouth with a muzzleAs long as anyone wicked is in my presence.”</span>
<span id="p614" class="sentence">2  I was speechless and silent;I kept quiet even about what is good,But my pain was intense.</span>
<span id="p615" class="sentence">3  My heart smoldered inside me.
As I pondered, the fire kept burning.
Then my tongue spoke:</span>
<span id="p616" class="sentence">4  “O Jehovah, help me to know what my end will be,And the measure of my days,So that I may know how short my life is.</span>
<span id="p617" class="sentence">5  Indeed, you have made my days just a few;And my life span is as nothing before you.
Surely every man, though he seems secure, is nothing but a mere breath. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p618" class="sentence">6  Surely every man walks about like a shadow.
He rushes around for nothing.
He piles up wealth, not knowing who will enjoy it.</span>
<span id="p619" class="sentence">7  What, then, can I hope for, O Jehovah?
You are my only hope.</span>
<span id="p620" class="sentence">8  Save me from all my transgressions.
Do not let the foolish one make me an object of contempt.</span>
<span id="p621" class="sentence">9  I remained speechless;I could not open my mouth,Because this was your doing.</span>
<span id="p622" class="sentence">10  Remove your plague from me.
I am worn down because your hand strikes me.</span>
<span id="p623" class="sentence">11  You correct man with punishment for his error;You consume the things he treasures just as a moth does.
Surely every man is but a mere breath. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p624" class="sentence">12  Hear my prayer, O Jehovah,Listen to my cry for help.
Do not ignore my tears.
For I am but a foreign resident to you,A traveler passing through, just like all my forefathers.</span>
<span id="p625" class="sentence">13  Turn your harsh gaze away from me so that I may cheer upBefore I pass away and I am gone.”</span></p></level1>
