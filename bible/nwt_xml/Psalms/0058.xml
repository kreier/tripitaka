<level1><h1 id="p898">Psalm 58 To the director; set to “Do Not Bring to Ruin.” Of David. Mikʹtam.</h1>
<p><span id="p899" class="sentence">Can you speak about righteousness when you are silent?
Can you judge in uprightness, you sons of men?</span>
<span id="p900" class="sentence">2  Instead, you devise unrighteousness in your heart,And your hands dispense violence in the land.</span>
<span id="p901" class="sentence">3  The wicked go astray from birth;They are wayward, liars from the time they are born.</span>
<span id="p902" class="sentence">4  Their venom is like the venom of serpents;They are deaf like the cobra that stops up its ear.</span>
<span id="p903" class="sentence">5  It will not listen to the voice of charmers,No matter how skillful their spells.</span>
<span id="p904" class="sentence">6  O God, knock the teeth out of their mouth!
Break the jaws of these lions, O Jehovah!</span>
<span id="p905" class="sentence">7  May they disappear like waters that drain away.
May He bend his bow and make them fall by his arrows.</span>
<span id="p906" class="sentence">8  May they be like a snail that melts away as it moves along;Like a woman’s stillborn child who never sees the sun.</span>
<span id="p907" class="sentence">9  Before your cooking pots feel the heat of the bramble,He will sweep away both the moist and the burning twig, as in a storm wind.</span>
<span id="p908" class="sentence">10  The righteous one will rejoice because he has seen the vengeance;His feet will be drenched with the blood of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p909" class="sentence">11  Then men will say: “Surely there is a reward for the righteous.
There is indeed a God who judges in the earth.”</span></p></level1>
