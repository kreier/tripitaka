<level1><h1 id="p1636">Psalm 97</h1>
<p><span id="p1637" class="sentence">Jehovah has become King!
Let the earth be joyful.
Let the many islands rejoice.</span>
<span id="p1638" class="sentence">2  Clouds and thick gloom are all around him;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.</span>
<span id="p1639" class="sentence">3  Fire goes before himAnd consumes his adversaries on every side.</span>
<span id="p1640" class="sentence">4  His lightning bolts light up the land;The earth sees it and trembles.</span>
<span id="p1641" class="sentence">5  The mountains melt like wax before Jehovah,Before the Lord of the whole earth.</span>
<span id="p1642" class="sentence">6  The heavens proclaim his righteousness,And all the peoples see his glory.</span>
<span id="p1643" class="sentence">7  Let all those serving any carved image be put to shame,Those who boast about their worthless gods.
Bow down to him, all you gods.</span>
<span id="p1644" class="sentence">8  Zion hears and rejoices;The towns of Judah are joyfulBecause of your judgments, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1645" class="sentence">9  For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth;You are exalted far above all other gods.</span>
<span id="p1646" class="sentence">10  O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.
He is guarding the lives of his loyal ones;He rescues them from the hand of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p1647" class="sentence">11  Light has flashed up for the righteousAnd rejoicing for those upright in heart.</span>
<span id="p1648" class="sentence">12  Rejoice in Jehovah, you righteous ones,And give thanks to his holy name.</span></p></level1>
