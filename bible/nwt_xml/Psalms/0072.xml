<level1><h1 id="p1133">Psalm 72 Regarding Solomon.</h1>
<p><span id="p1134" class="sentence">O God, give your judgments to the king,And endow the son of the king with your righteousness.</span>
<span id="p1135" class="sentence">2  May he plead the cause of your people with righteousness,And of your lowly ones with justice.</span>
<span id="p1136" class="sentence">3  May the mountains bring peace to the people,And may the hills bring righteousness.</span>
<span id="p1137" class="sentence">4  Let him defend the lowly among the people,Let him save the sons of the poor,And let him crush the defrauder.</span>
<span id="p1138" class="sentence">5  They will fear you as long as there is a sunAnd as long as the moon remains,For generation after generation.</span>
<span id="p1139" class="sentence">6  He will be like the rain that falls on the mown grass,Like showers of rain that water the earth.</span>
<span id="p1140" class="sentence">7  In his days the righteous will flourish,And peace will abound until the moon is no more.</span>
<span id="p1141" class="sentence">8  He will have subjects from sea to seaAnd from the River to the ends of the earth.</span>
<span id="p1142" class="sentence">9  The desert dwellers will bow down before him,And his enemies will lick the dust.</span>
<span id="p1143" class="sentence">10  The kings of Tarʹshish and of the islands will pay tribute.
The kings of Sheʹba and of Seʹba will present gifts.</span>
<span id="p1144" class="sentence">11  All the kings will bow down before him,And all the nations will serve him.</span>
<span id="p1145" class="sentence">12  For he will rescue the poor who cry for help,Also the lowly one and whoever has no helper.</span>
<span id="p1146" class="sentence">13  He will have pity on the lowly and the poor,And the lives of the poor he will save.</span>
<span id="p1147" class="sentence">14  From oppression and from violence he will rescue them,And their blood will be precious in his eyes.</span>
<span id="p1148" class="sentence">15  May he live and be given the gold of Sheʹba.
May prayers be said for him continually,And may he be blessed all day long.</span>
<span id="p1149" class="sentence">16  There will be an abundance of grain on the earth;On the top of the mountains it will overflow.
His fruit will flourish as in Lebʹa·non,And in the cities people will blossom like the vegetation of the earth.</span>
<span id="p1150" class="sentence">17  May his name endure forever,And may it prosper as long as the sun.
May people obtain a blessing for themselves by means of him;May all nations pronounce him happy.</span>
<span id="p1151" class="sentence">18  May Jehovah God be praised, Israel’s God,Who alone does wonderful things.</span>
<span id="p1152" class="sentence">19  May his glorious name be praised forever,And may his glory fill the whole earth.
Amen and Amen.</span>
<span id="p1153" class="sentence">20  This completes the prayers of David, the son of Jesʹse.</span></p></level1>
