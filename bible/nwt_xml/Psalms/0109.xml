<level1><h1 id="p1925">Psalm 109 To the director. Of David. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p1926" class="sentence">O God whom I praise, do not remain silent.</span>
<span id="p1927" class="sentence">2  For the wicked and the deceitful open their mouths against me.
They speak about me with lying tongues;</span>
<span id="p1928" class="sentence">3  They surround me with hateful words,And they attack me without cause.</span>
<span id="p1929" class="sentence">4  They resist me in response to my love;But I continue to pray.</span>
<span id="p1930" class="sentence">5  They repay me with bad for goodAnd hatred for my love.</span>
<span id="p1931" class="sentence">6  Appoint a wicked man over him;May a resister stand at his right hand.</span>
<span id="p1932" class="sentence">7  When he is judged, may he be found guilty;May even his prayer be counted as a sin.</span>
<span id="p1933" class="sentence">8  Let his days be few;His office of oversight let someone else take.</span>
<span id="p1934" class="sentence">9  Let his children become fatherless,And his wife, a widow.</span>
<span id="p1935" class="sentence">10  May his children become wandering beggars,Foraging for food from their ruined homes.</span>
<span id="p1936" class="sentence">11  May his creditor seize all that he has,And may strangers plunder his possessions.</span>
<span id="p1937" class="sentence">12  May no one extend kindness to him,And may no one show favor to his fatherless children.</span>
<span id="p1938" class="sentence">13  Let his descendants be cut off;May their name be erased within a generation.</span>
<span id="p1939" class="sentence">14  Let the error of his forefathers be remembered by Jehovah,And may the sin of his mother not be erased.</span>
<span id="p1940" class="sentence">15  May Jehovah always be mindful of what they have done;And may he cut off the memory of them from the earth.</span>
<span id="p1941" class="sentence">16  For he did not remember to show kindness,But he kept pursuing the oppressed, poor, and brokenhearted manTo put him to death.</span>
<span id="p1942" class="sentence">17  He loved to pronounce a curse, so that is what came upon him;He had no desire to bless, so he received no blessing.</span>
<span id="p1943" class="sentence">18  He was clothed with curses as his garment.
And they were poured into his body like water,Into his bones like oil.</span>
<span id="p1944" class="sentence">19  May his curses be like the clothing in which he wraps himselfAnd like a belt he always wears.</span>
<span id="p1945" class="sentence">20  This is the payment from Jehovah for the one who resists meAnd for those who speak evil things against me.</span>
<span id="p1946" class="sentence">21  But you, Jehovah the Sovereign Lord,Act in my behalf for the sake of your name.
Rescue me, because your loyal love is good.</span>
<span id="p1947" class="sentence">22  For I am helpless and poor,And my heart has been pierced within me.</span>
<span id="p1948" class="sentence">23  I am passing away like a fading shadow;I have been shaken off like a locust.</span>
<span id="p1949" class="sentence">24  My knees give way from fasting;My body is thin, and I am wasting away.</span>
<span id="p1950" class="sentence">25  I have become the object of their taunts.
When they see me, they shake their heads.</span>
<span id="p1951" class="sentence">26  Help me, O Jehovah my God;Save me by your loyal love.</span>
<span id="p1952" class="sentence">27  May they know that this is by your hand;That you, O Jehovah, have done it.</span>
<span id="p1953" class="sentence">28  Let them pronounce a curse, but may you give a blessing.
When they rise up against me, may they be put to shame,But let your servant rejoice.</span>
<span id="p1954" class="sentence">29  Let those who resist me be clothed with humiliation;May they be wrapped in their shame as in a robe.</span>
<span id="p1955" class="sentence">30  My mouth will fervently praise Jehovah;I will praise him in front of many people.</span>
<span id="p1956" class="sentence">31  For he will stand at the right hand of the poorTo save him from those who condemn him.</span></p></level1>
