<p><span id="p338" class="sentence">To you, O Jehovah, I turn.</span>
<span id="p339" class="sentence">2  My God, I trust in you;Do not let me be put to shame.
Do not let my enemies gloat over me.</span>
<span id="p340" class="sentence">3  Surely none who hope in you will be put to shame,But shame awaits those who are treacherous without cause.</span>
<span id="p341" class="sentence">4  Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;Teach me your paths.</span>
<span id="p342" class="sentence">5  Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me,For you are my God of salvation.
ו [Waw]
In you I hope all day long.</span>
<span id="p343" class="sentence">6  Remember your mercy, O Jehovah, and your loyal love,Which you have always shown.</span>
<span id="p344" class="sentence">7  Do not remember the sins of my youth and my transgressions.
Remember me according to your loyal love,For the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p345" class="sentence">8  Good and upright is Jehovah.
That is why he instructs sinners in the way to live.</span>
<span id="p346" class="sentence">9  He will guide the meek in what is right,And he will teach the meek ones his way.</span>
<span id="p347" class="sentence">10  All the paths of Jehovah are loyal love and faithfulnessFor those observing his covenant and his reminders.</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">11  For the sake of your name, O Jehovah,Forgive my error, though it is great.</span>
<span id="p349" class="sentence">12  Who is the man fearing Jehovah?
He will instruct him about the way he should choose.</span>
<span id="p350" class="sentence">13  He will experience what is good,And his descendants will take possession of the earth.</span>
<span id="p351" class="sentence">14  Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him,And he makes his covenant known to them.</span>
<span id="p352" class="sentence">15  My eyes are always toward Jehovah,For he will free my feet from the net.</span>
<span id="p353" class="sentence">16  Turn your face to me and show me favor,For I am alone and helpless.</span>
<span id="p354" class="sentence">17  The distresses of my heart have multiplied;Free me from my anguish.</span>
<span id="p355" class="sentence">18  See my affliction and my trouble,And pardon all my sins.</span>
<span id="p356" class="sentence">19  See how numerous my enemies areAnd how violent their hatred is for me.</span>
<span id="p357" class="sentence">20  Guard my life and save me.
Do not let me be put to shame, for I have taken refuge in you.</span>
<span id="p358" class="sentence">21  May integrity and uprightness safeguard me,For my hope is in you.</span>
<span id="p359" class="sentence">22  O God, rescue Israel out of all his distresses.</span></p></level1>
