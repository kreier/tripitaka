<level1><h1 id="p2439">Psalm 139 For the director. Of David. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p2440" class="sentence">O Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know me.</span>
<span id="p2441" class="sentence">2  You know when I sit down and when I rise up.
You discern my thoughts from afar.</span>
<span id="p2442" class="sentence">3  You observe me when I travel and when I lie down;You are familiar with all my ways.</span>
<span id="p2443" class="sentence">4  There is not a word on my tongue,But look! O Jehovah, you already know it well.</span>
<span id="p2444" class="sentence">5  Behind and before me, you surround me;And you lay your hand upon me.</span>
<span id="p2445" class="sentence">6  Such knowledge is beyond my comprehension.
It is too high for me to reach.</span>
<span id="p2446" class="sentence">7  Where can I escape from your spirit,And where can I run away from your face?</span>
<span id="p2447" class="sentence">8  If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there,And if I were to make my bed in the Grave, look! you would be there.</span>
<span id="p2448" class="sentence">9  If I would fly away with the wings of the dawnTo reside by the most remote sea,</span>
<span id="p2449" class="sentence">10  Even there your hand would lead meAnd your right hand would take hold of me.</span>
<span id="p2450" class="sentence">11  If I say: “Surely darkness will conceal me!”
Then the night around me would become light.</span>
<span id="p2451" class="sentence">12  Even the darkness would not be too dark for you,But night would be as bright as the day;Darkness is the same as light to you.</span>
<span id="p2452" class="sentence">13  For you produced my kidneys;You kept me screened off in my mother’s womb.</span>
<span id="p2453" class="sentence">14  I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.
Your works are wonderful,I know this very well.</span>
<span id="p2454" class="sentence">15  My bones were not hidden from youWhen I was made in secret,When I was woven in the depths of the earth.</span>
<span id="p2455" class="sentence">16  Your eyes even saw me as an embryo;All its parts were written in your bookRegarding the days when they were formed,Before any of them existed.</span>
<span id="p2456" class="sentence">17  So to me, how precious your thoughts are!
O God, how vast is the sum of them!</span>
<span id="p2457" class="sentence">18  If I try to count them, they outnumber the grains of sand.
When I awake, I am still with you.</span>
<span id="p2458" class="sentence">19  O God, if only you would slay the wicked!
Then the violent men would depart from me,</span>
<span id="p2459" class="sentence">20  Those who say things against you with evil intent;They are your adversaries who take up your name in a worthless way.</span>
<span id="p2460" class="sentence">21  Do I not hate those who hate you, O Jehovah,And loathe those who revolt against you?</span>
<span id="p2461" class="sentence">22  I have nothing but hatred for them;They have become real enemies to me.</span>
<span id="p2462" class="sentence">23  Search through me, O God, and know my heart.
Examine me, and know my anxious thoughts.</span>
<span id="p2463" class="sentence">24  See whether there is in me any harmful way,And lead me in the way of eternity.</span></p></level1>
