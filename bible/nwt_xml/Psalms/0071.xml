<level1><h1 id="p1108">Psalm 71</h1>
<p><span id="p1109" class="sentence">In you, O Jehovah, I have taken refuge.
May I never be put to shame.</span>
<span id="p1110" class="sentence">2  In your righteousness save me and rescue me.
Incline your ear to me and save me.</span>
<span id="p1111" class="sentence">3  Become for me a rock fortressWhere I can always enter.
Give the command to save me,For you are my crag and my stronghold.</span>
<span id="p1112" class="sentence">4  O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked,From the grasp of the unjust oppressor.</span>
<span id="p1113" class="sentence">5  For you are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah;I have trusted in you since my youth.</span>
<span id="p1114" class="sentence">6  I have depended on you from birth;It was you who took me from my mother’s womb.
I praise you constantly.</span>
<span id="p1115" class="sentence">7  I have become like a miracle to many,But you are my strong refuge.</span>
<span id="p1116" class="sentence">8  My mouth is filled with your praise;All day long I tell about your splendor.</span>
<span id="p1117" class="sentence">9  Do not cast me off in my old age;Do not abandon me when my strength fails.</span>
<span id="p1118" class="sentence">10  My enemies speak against me,And those seeking to take my life conspire together,</span>
<span id="p1119" class="sentence">11  Saying: “God has abandoned him.
Chase after him and seize him, for there is no one to save him.”</span>
<span id="p1120" class="sentence">12  O God, do not remain far away from me.
O my God, hurry to help me.</span>
<span id="p1121" class="sentence">13  May those who are resisting meBe put to shame and perish.
May those seeking my calamityBe covered with disgrace and humiliation.</span>
<span id="p1122" class="sentence">14  But as for me, I will continue to wait;I will add to your praise.</span>
<span id="p1123" class="sentence">15  My mouth will recount your righteousness,All day long your acts of salvation,Though they are too many for me to grasp.</span>
<span id="p1124" class="sentence">16  I will come and tell about your mighty acts,O Sovereign Lord Jehovah;I will mention your righteousness, yours alone.</span>
<span id="p1125" class="sentence">17  O God, you have taught me from my youth,And until now I keep declaring your wonderful works.</span>
<span id="p1126" class="sentence">18  Even when I am old and gray, O God, do not abandon me.
Let me tell the next generation about your powerAnd about your mightiness to all those who are to come.</span>
<span id="p1127" class="sentence">19  Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heights;You have done great things;O God, who is like you?</span>
<span id="p1128" class="sentence">20  Though you have made me experience much distress and calamity,Revive me again;Bring me up from the depths of the earth.</span>
<span id="p1129" class="sentence">21  May you increase my greatnessAnd surround and comfort me.</span>
<span id="p1130" class="sentence">22  Then I will praise you on a stringed instrumentBecause of your faithfulness, O my God.
I will sing your praises with the harp,O Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1131" class="sentence">23  My lips will shout joyfully as I sing praises to you,For you have saved my life.</span>
<span id="p1132" class="sentence">24  My tongue will speak about your righteousness all day long,For those seeking my destruction will be ashamed and disgraced.</span></p></level1>
