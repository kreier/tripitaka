<level1><h1 id="p169">Psalm 16 A mikʹtam of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p170" class="sentence">Protect me, O God, for I have taken refuge in you.</span>
<span id="p171" class="sentence">2  I have said to Jehovah: “You are Jehovah, my Source of goodness.</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">3  And the holy ones in the earth,The majestic ones, bring me great delight.”</span>
<span id="p173" class="sentence">4  Those who pursue other gods multiply their sorrows.
I will never pour out their drink offerings of blood,Nor will my lips mention their names.</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">5  Jehovah is my portion, my allotted share, and my cup.
You safeguard my inheritance.</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">6  Pleasant places have been measured out to me.
Yes, I am content with my inheritance.</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">7  I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice.
Even during the night, my innermost thoughts correct me.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">8  I keep Jehovah before me constantly.
Because he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken.</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">9  So my heart rejoices, my whole being is joyful.
And I reside in security.</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">10  For you will not leave me in the Grave.
You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">11  You make known to me the path of life.
In your presence is abundant joy;There is happiness at your right hand forever.</span></p></level1>
