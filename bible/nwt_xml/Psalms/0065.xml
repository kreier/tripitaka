<level1><h1 id="p986">Psalm 65 To the director. A melody of David. A song.</h1>
<p><span id="p987" class="sentence">Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion;We will pay our vows to you.</span>
<span id="p988" class="sentence">2  O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.</span>
<span id="p989" class="sentence">3  My errors have overwhelmed me,But you cover over our transgressions.</span>
<span id="p990" class="sentence">4  Happy is the one whom you choose and bring nearTo reside in your courtyards.
We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house,Your holy temple.</span>
<span id="p991" class="sentence">5  You will answer us with awe-inspiring deeds of righteousness,O God of our salvation;You are the Confidence of all the ends of the earthAnd of those distant across the sea.</span>
<span id="p992" class="sentence">6  You firmly established the mountains by your power;You are clothed with mightiness.</span>
<span id="p993" class="sentence">7  You calm the raging seas,The crash of their waves and the turmoil of the nations.</span>
<span id="p994" class="sentence">8  The inhabitants of remote places will be awestruck by your signs;You will cause those from the sunrise to the sunset to shout joyfully.</span>
<span id="p995" class="sentence">9  You care for the earth,Making it abundantly fruitful and very rich.
The stream from God is full of water;You provide grain for them,For that is how you prepared the earth.</span>
<span id="p996" class="sentence">10  You drench its furrows and level off its plowed soil;You soften it with showers of rain; you bless its growth.</span>
<span id="p997" class="sentence">11  You crown the year with your goodness;Your tracks overflow with abundance.</span>
<span id="p998" class="sentence">12  The pastures of the wilderness keep overflowing,And the hills are clothed with joyfulness.</span>
<span id="p999" class="sentence">13  The pastures are covered with flocks,And the valleys are carpeted with grain.
They shout in triumph, yes, they sing.</span></p></level1>
