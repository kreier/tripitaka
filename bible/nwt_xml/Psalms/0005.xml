<level1><h1 id="p39">Psalm 5 To the director for Neʹhi·loth. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p40" class="sentence">Listen to my words, O Jehovah;Be attentive to my sighing.</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">2  Pay attention to my cry for help,O my King and my God, because to you I pray.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">3  O Jehovah, you will hear my voice in the morning;In the morning I will express my concern to you and wait expectantly.</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">4  For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness;No one bad may remain with you.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">5  No arrogant person may stand in your presence.
You hate all those who behave wickedly;</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">6  You will destroy those who speak lies.
Jehovah detests violent and deceptive people.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">7  But I will come into your house because of your great loyal love;I will bow down toward your holy temple in reverential fear of you.</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">8  Lead me, O Jehovah, in your righteousness because of my foes;Make your way clear for me.</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">9  For nothing they say can be trusted;Within them is nothing but malice;Their throat is an open grave;They flatter with their tongue.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">10  But God will declare them guilty;Their own schemes will cause their downfall.
May they be driven away because of their many transgressions,For they have rebelled against you.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">11  But all those who take refuge in you will rejoice;They will always shout joyfully.
You will block approach to them,And those loving your name will rejoice in you.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">12  For you will bless anyone righteous, O Jehovah;You will surround them with approval as with a large shield.</span></p></level1>
