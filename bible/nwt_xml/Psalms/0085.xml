<p><span id="p1418" class="sentence">You have shown favor, O Jehovah, to your land;You brought back those of Jacob who were taken captive.</span>
<span id="p1419" class="sentence">2  You have pardoned the error of your people;You forgave all their sin. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1420" class="sentence">3  You held back all your fury;You turned away from your hot anger.</span>
<span id="p1421" class="sentence">4  Restore us, O God of our salvation,And set aside your displeasure with us.</span>
<span id="p1422" class="sentence">5  Will you be furious with us forever?
Will you prolong your anger to generation after generation?</span>
<span id="p1423" class="sentence">6  Will you not revive us againSo that your people may rejoice in you?</span>
<span id="p1424" class="sentence">7  Show your loyal love to us, O Jehovah,And grant us your salvation.</span>
<span id="p1425" class="sentence">8  I will listen to what the true God Jehovah says,For he will speak peace to his people, to his loyal ones,But let them not return to overconfidence.</span>
<span id="p1426" class="sentence">9  Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,So that his glory may reside in our land.</span>
<span id="p1427" class="sentence">10  Loyal love and faithfulness will meet together;Righteousness and peace will kiss each other.</span>
<span id="p1428" class="sentence">11  Faithfulness will sprout from the earth,And righteousness will look down from the heavens.</span>
<span id="p1429" class="sentence">12  Yes, Jehovah will give what is good,And our land will yield its harvest.</span>
<span id="p1430" class="sentence">13  Righteousness will walk before himAnd make a path for his footsteps.</span></p></level1>
