<level1><h1 id="p8">Psalm 2</h1>
<p><span id="p9" class="sentence">Why are the nations agitatedAnd the peoples muttering an empty thing?</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">2  The kings of the earth take their standAnd high officials gather together as oneAgainst Jehovah and against his anointed one.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">3  They say: “Let us tear off their shacklesAnd throw off their ropes!”</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">4  The One enthroned in the heavens will laugh;Jehovah will scoff at them.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">5  At that time he will speak to them in his angerAnd terrify them in his burning anger,</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">6  Saying: “I myself have installed my kingOn Zion, my holy mountain.”</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">7  Let me proclaim the decree of Jehovah;He said to me: “You are my son;Today I have become your father.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">8  Ask of me, and I will give nations as your inheritanceAnd the ends of the earth as your possession.</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">9  You will break them with an iron scepter,And you will smash them like a piece of pottery.”</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">10  So now, you kings, show insight;Accept correction, you judges of the earth.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">11  Serve Jehovah with fear,And rejoice with trembling.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">12  Honor the son, or God will become indignantAnd you will perish from the way,For His anger flares up quickly.
Happy are all those taking refuge in Him.</span></p></level1>
