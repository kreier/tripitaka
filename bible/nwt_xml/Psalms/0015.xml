<p><span id="p164" class="sentence">O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent?
Who may reside in your holy mountain?</span>
<span id="p165" class="sentence">2  The one who is walking faultlessly,Practicing what is rightAnd speaking the truth in his heart.</span>
<span id="p166" class="sentence">3  He does not slander with his tongue,He does nothing bad to his neighbor,And he does not defame his friends.</span>
<span id="p167" class="sentence">4  He rejects anyone who is contemptible,But he honors those fearing Jehovah.
He does not go back on his promise, even when it is bad for him.</span>
<span id="p168" class="sentence">5  He does not lend his money on interest,And he does not accept a bribe against the innocent.
Whoever does these things will never be shaken.</span></p></level1>
