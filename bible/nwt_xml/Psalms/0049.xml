<level1><h1 id="p758">Psalm 49 To the director. Of the sons of Korʹah. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p759" class="sentence">Hear this, all you peoples.
Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the world,</span>
<span id="p760" class="sentence">2  Both small and great,Rich and poor alike.</span>
<span id="p761" class="sentence">3  My own mouth will speak wisdom,And the meditation of my heart will show understanding.</span>
<span id="p762" class="sentence">4  I will pay attention to a proverb;I will expound my riddle with the harp.</span>
<span id="p763" class="sentence">5  Why should I fear during times of trouble,When I am surrounded by the evil of those trying to overthrow me?</span>
<span id="p764" class="sentence">6  Those who are trusting in their wealthAnd who boast about their great riches,</span>
<span id="p765" class="sentence">7  None of them can ever redeem a brotherOr give to God a ransom for him,</span>
<span id="p766" class="sentence">8  (The ransom price for their life is so preciousThat it is always beyond their reach);</span>
<span id="p767" class="sentence">9  That he should live forever and not see the pit.</span>
<span id="p768" class="sentence">10  He sees that even wise people die;The stupid and the unreasoning perish together,And they must leave their wealth to others.</span>
<span id="p769" class="sentence">11  Their inner wish is that their houses will last forever,Their tents to generation after generation.
They have named their estates after themselves.</span>
<span id="p770" class="sentence">12  But man, although honored, will not remain;He is no better than the beasts that perish.</span>
<span id="p771" class="sentence">13  This is the way of the stupid onesAnd of those who follow them, who take pleasure in their empty words. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p772" class="sentence">14  They are assigned like sheep to the Grave.
Death will shepherd them;The upright will rule over them in the morning.
Every trace of them will fade away;The Grave rather than a palace will be their home.</span>
<span id="p773" class="sentence">15  But God will redeem me from the power of the Grave,For he will take hold of me. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p774" class="sentence">16  Do not be afraid because a man becomes rich,Because the splendor of his house increases,</span>
<span id="p775" class="sentence">17  For when he dies he can take nothing with him;His splendor will not go down with him.</span>
<span id="p776" class="sentence">18  For during his lifetime he congratulates himself.
(People praise you when you prosper.)</span>
<span id="p777" class="sentence">19  But he finally joins the generation of his forefathers.
They will never again see the light.</span>
<span id="p778" class="sentence">20  A man who does not understand this, although honored,Is no better than the beasts that perish.</span></p></level1>
