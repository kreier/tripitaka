<p><span id="p2026" class="sentence">I love JehovahBecause he hears my voice, my pleas for help.</span>
<span id="p2027" class="sentence">2  For he inclines his ear to me,And I will call on him as long as I live.</span>
<span id="p2028" class="sentence">3  The ropes of death encircled me;The Grave had me in its grip.
I was overcome by distress and grief.</span>
<span id="p2029" class="sentence">4  But I called on the name of Jehovah:
“O Jehovah, rescue me!”</span>
<span id="p2030" class="sentence">5  Jehovah is compassionate and righteous;Our God is merciful.</span>
<span id="p2031" class="sentence">6  Jehovah is guarding the inexperienced.
I was brought low, and he saved me.</span>
<span id="p2032" class="sentence">7  Let my soul rest once again,For Jehovah has dealt kindly with me.</span>
<span id="p2033" class="sentence">8  You have rescued me from death,My eye from tears, my foot from stumbling.</span>
<span id="p2034" class="sentence">9  I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living.</span>
<span id="p2035" class="sentence">10  I had faith, for I spoke;I was greatly afflicted.</span>
<span id="p2036" class="sentence">11  As for me, I panicked and said:
“Every man is a liar.”</span>
<span id="p2037" class="sentence">12  With what will I repay JehovahFor all the good he has done for me?</span>
<span id="p2038" class="sentence">13  I will take up the cup of salvation,And I will call on the name of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p2039" class="sentence">14  I will pay my vows to JehovahIn the presence of all his people.</span>
<span id="p2040" class="sentence">15  Costly in the eyes of JehovahIs the death of his loyal ones.</span>
<span id="p2041" class="sentence">16  I beg you, O Jehovah,For I am your servant.
I am your servant, the son of your slave girl.
You have freed me from my bonds.</span>
<span id="p2042" class="sentence">17  I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving;I will call on the name of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p2043" class="sentence">18  I will pay my vows to JehovahIn the presence of all his people,</span>
<span id="p2044" class="sentence">19  In the courtyards of the house of Jehovah,In your midst, O Jerusalem.
Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
