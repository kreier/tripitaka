<level1><h1 id="p1713">Psalm 103 Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p1714" class="sentence">Let me praise Jehovah;Let everything within me praise his holy name.</span>
<span id="p1715" class="sentence">2  Let me praise Jehovah;May I never forget all that he has done.</span>
<span id="p1716" class="sentence">3  He forgives all your errorsAnd heals all your ailments;</span>
<span id="p1717" class="sentence">4  He reclaims your life from the pitAnd crowns you with his loyal love and mercy.</span>
<span id="p1718" class="sentence">5  He satisfies you with good things all your life,So that your youth is renewed like that of an eagle.</span>
<span id="p1719" class="sentence">6  Jehovah acts with righteousness and justiceFor all who are oppressed.</span>
<span id="p1720" class="sentence">7  He made known his ways to Moses,His deeds to the sons of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1721" class="sentence">8  Jehovah is merciful and compassionate,Slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.</span>
<span id="p1722" class="sentence">9  He will not always find fault,Nor will he stay resentful forever.</span>
<span id="p1723" class="sentence">10  He has not dealt with us according to our sins,Nor has he repaid us what our errors deserve.</span>
<span id="p1724" class="sentence">11  For as the heavens are higher than the earth,So great is his loyal love toward those who fear him.</span>
<span id="p1725" class="sentence">12  As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset,So far off from us he has put our transgressions.</span>
<span id="p1726" class="sentence">13  As a father shows mercy to his sons,Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.</span>
<span id="p1727" class="sentence">14  For he well knows how we are formed,Remembering that we are dust.</span>
<span id="p1728" class="sentence">15  As for mortal man, his days are like those of grass;He blooms like a blossom of the field.</span>
<span id="p1729" class="sentence">16  But when a wind blows, it is no more,As though it was never there.</span>
<span id="p1730" class="sentence">17  But the loyal love of Jehovah is for all eternityToward those who fear him,And his righteousness toward their children’s children,</span>
<span id="p1731" class="sentence">18  Toward those who keep his covenantAnd those who are careful to observe his orders.</span>
<span id="p1732" class="sentence">19  Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens;And his kingship rules over everything.</span>
<span id="p1733" class="sentence">20  Praise Jehovah, all you his angels, mighty in power,Who carry out his word, obeying his voice.</span>
<span id="p1734" class="sentence">21  Praise Jehovah, all his armies,His ministers who do his will.</span>
<span id="p1735" class="sentence">22  Praise Jehovah, all his works,In all the places where he rules.
Let my whole being praise Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
