<level1><h1 id="p373">Psalm 27 Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p374" class="sentence">Jehovah is my light and my salvation.
Whom should I fear?
Jehovah is the stronghold of my life.
Whom should I dread?</span>
<span id="p375" class="sentence">2  When evil men attacked me to devour my flesh,My adversaries and my enemies were the ones who stumbled and fell.</span>
<span id="p376" class="sentence">3  Though an army should set up camp against me,My heart will not fear.
Though war should break out against me,Even then I will remain confident.</span>
<span id="p377" class="sentence">4  One thing I have asked from Jehovah—It is what I will look for—That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life,To gaze upon the pleasantness of JehovahAnd to look with appreciation upon his temple.</span>
<span id="p378" class="sentence">5  For he will hide me in his shelter on the day of calamity;He will conceal me in the secret place of his tent;High on a rock he will place me.</span>
<span id="p379" class="sentence">6  Now my head is high above my enemies who surround me;I will offer sacrifices at his tent with joyful shouting;I will sing praises to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p380" class="sentence">7  Hear me, O Jehovah, when I cry out;Show me favor and answer me.</span>
<span id="p381" class="sentence">8  Speaking for you, my heart has said:
“Seek to find my face.”
Your face, O Jehovah, I will seek to find.</span>
<span id="p382" class="sentence">9  Do not hide your face from me.
Do not turn your servant away in your anger.
You are my helper;Do not forsake me or leave me, my God of salvation.</span>
<span id="p383" class="sentence">10  Even if my own father and mother abandon me,Jehovah himself will take me in.</span>
<span id="p384" class="sentence">11  Instruct me in your way, O Jehovah,Lead me in the path of uprightness because of my foes.</span>
<span id="p385" class="sentence">12  Do not hand me over to my adversaries,For false witnesses have risen up against me,And they threaten me with violence.</span>
<span id="p386" class="sentence">13  Where would I be if I did not have faithThat I would see Jehovah’s goodness in the land of the living?</span>
<span id="p387" class="sentence">14  Hope in Jehovah;Be courageous and strong of heart.
Yes, hope in Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
