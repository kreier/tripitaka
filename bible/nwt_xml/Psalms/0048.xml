<level1><h1 id="p743">Psalm 48 A song. A melody of the sons of Korʹah.</h1>
<p><span id="p744" class="sentence">Jehovah is great and most worthy of praiseIn the city of our God, in his holy mountain.</span>
<span id="p745" class="sentence">2  Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth,Is Mount Zion in the far north,The city of the Grand King.</span>
<span id="p746" class="sentence">3  In her fortified towers,God has made known that he is a secure refuge.</span>
<span id="p747" class="sentence">4  For look! kings have assembled;Together they have advanced.</span>
<span id="p748" class="sentence">5  When they saw it, they were amazed.
They panicked and fled in terror.</span>
<span id="p749" class="sentence">6  Trembling seized them there,Anguish like that of a woman giving birth.</span>
<span id="p750" class="sentence">7  With an east wind you wreck the ships of Tarʹshish.</span>
<span id="p751" class="sentence">8  What we heard about, we have now seen for ourselvesIn the city of Jehovah of armies, in the city of our God.
God will firmly establish it forever. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p752" class="sentence">9  We ponder your loyal love, O God,Within your temple.</span>
<span id="p753" class="sentence">10  Like your name, O God, your praiseReaches to the ends of the earth.
Your right hand is filled with righteousness.</span>
<span id="p754" class="sentence">11  May Mount Zion rejoice,May the towns of Judah be joyful, because of your judgments.</span>
<span id="p755" class="sentence">12  March around Zion; go all around it;Count its towers.</span>
<span id="p756" class="sentence">13  Set your hearts upon its ramparts.
Inspect its fortified towers,So that you may tell about it to future generations.</span>
<span id="p757" class="sentence">14  For this God is our God forever and ever.
He will guide us forevermore.</span></p></level1>
