<level1><h1 id="p1000">Psalm 66 To the director. A song. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p1001" class="sentence">Shout in triumph to God, all the earth.</span>
<span id="p1002" class="sentence">2  Sing praises to his glorious name.
Make his praise glorious.</span>
<span id="p1003" class="sentence">3  Say to God: “How awe-inspiring your works are!
Because of your great power,Your enemies will cringe before you.</span>
<span id="p1004" class="sentence">4  All the earth will bow down to you;They will sing praises to you;They will sing praises to your name.” (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1005" class="sentence">5  Come and see the works of God.
His deeds toward the sons of men are awe-inspiring.</span>
<span id="p1006" class="sentence">6  He changed the sea into dry land;They crossed the river on foot.
There we rejoiced in him.</span>
<span id="p1007" class="sentence">7  He rules forever by his might.
His eyes keep watch on the nations.
Those who are stubborn should not exalt themselves. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1008" class="sentence">8  Praise our God, you peoples,And let the sound of his praise be heard.</span>
<span id="p1009" class="sentence">9  He preserves us alive;He does not allow our feet to stumble.</span>
<span id="p1010" class="sentence">10  For you have examined us, O God;As silver is refined, so you have refined us.</span>
<span id="p1011" class="sentence">11  You brought us into a hunting net;You put a crushing burden upon us.</span>
<span id="p1012" class="sentence">12  You allowed mortal man to ride over us;We came through fire and through water;Then you brought us to a place of relief.</span>
<span id="p1013" class="sentence">13  I will come into your house with whole burnt offerings;I will pay my vows to you</span>
<span id="p1014" class="sentence">14  That my lips promisedAnd my mouth spoke when I was in distress.</span>
<span id="p1015" class="sentence">15  I will offer burnt offerings of fattened animals to youWith the smoke of sacrificial rams.
I will offer bulls along with male goats. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1016" class="sentence">16  Come and listen, all you who fear God,And I will tell you what he has done for me.</span>
<span id="p1017" class="sentence">17  I called to him with my mouthAnd glorified him with my tongue.</span>
<span id="p1018" class="sentence">18  If I had harbored anything hurtful in my heart,Jehovah would not have heard me.</span>
<span id="p1019" class="sentence">19  But God did hear;He paid attention to my prayer.</span>
<span id="p1020" class="sentence">20  Praise to God, who did not reject my prayerOr withhold his loyal love from me.</span></p></level1>
