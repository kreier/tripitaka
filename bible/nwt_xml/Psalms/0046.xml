<level1><h1 id="p721">Psalm 46 To the director. Of the sons of Korʹah. According to the Alʹa·moth style. A song.</h1>
<p><span id="p722" class="sentence">God is our refuge and strength,A help that is readily found in times of distress.</span>
<span id="p723" class="sentence">2  That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes change,Though the mountains topple into the depths of the sea,</span>
<span id="p724" class="sentence">3  Though its waters roar and foam over,Though the mountains rock on account of its turbulence. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p725" class="sentence">4  There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice,The holy grand tabernacle of the Most High.</span>
<span id="p726" class="sentence">5  God is in the city; it cannot be overthrown.
God will come to its aid at the break of dawn.</span>
<span id="p727" class="sentence">6  The nations were in an uproar, the kingdoms were overthrown;He raised his voice, and the earth melted.</span>
<span id="p728" class="sentence">7  Jehovah of armies is with us;The God of Jacob is our secure refuge. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p729" class="sentence">8  Come and witness the activities of Jehovah,How he has done astonishing things on the earth.</span>
<span id="p730" class="sentence">9  He is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth.
He breaks the bow and shatters the spear;He burns the military wagons with fire.</span>
<span id="p731" class="sentence">10  “Give in and know that I am God.
I will be exalted among the nations;I will be exalted in the earth.”</span>
<span id="p732" class="sentence">11  Jehovah of armies is with us;The God of Jacob is a secure refuge for us. (Selah)</span></p></level1>
