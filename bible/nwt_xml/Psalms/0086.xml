<level1><h1 id="p1431">Psalm 86 A prayer of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p1432" class="sentence">Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and answer me,For I am afflicted and poor.</span>
<span id="p1433" class="sentence">2  Guard my life, for I am loyal.
Save your servant who is trusting in you,For you are my God.</span>
<span id="p1434" class="sentence">3  Show me favor, O Jehovah,For I call to you all day long.</span>
<span id="p1435" class="sentence">4  Make your servant rejoice,For to you, O Jehovah, I turn.</span>
<span id="p1436" class="sentence">5  For you, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive;You abound in loyal love for all those who call on you.</span>
<span id="p1437" class="sentence">6  Listen, O Jehovah, to my prayer;And pay attention to my pleas for help.</span>
<span id="p1438" class="sentence">7  I call on you in the day of my distress,For you will answer me.</span>
<span id="p1439" class="sentence">8  There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah,There are no works like yours.</span>
<span id="p1440" class="sentence">9  All the nations that you madeWill come and bow down before you, O Jehovah,And they will give glory to your name.</span>
<span id="p1441" class="sentence">10  For you are great and do wondrous things;You are God, you alone.</span>
<span id="p1442" class="sentence">11  Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way.
I will walk in your truth.
Unify my heart to fear your name.</span>
<span id="p1443" class="sentence">12  I praise you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart,And I will glorify your name forever,</span>
<span id="p1444" class="sentence">13  For your loyal love toward me is great,And you have saved my life from the depths of the Grave.</span>
<span id="p1445" class="sentence">14  O God, presumptuous men rise up against me;A band of ruthless men seek to take my life,And they have no regard for you.</span>
<span id="p1446" class="sentence">15  But you, O Jehovah, are a God merciful and compassionate,Slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and faithfulness.</span>
<span id="p1447" class="sentence">16  Turn to me and show me favor.
Give your strength to your servant,And save the son of your slave girl.</span>
<span id="p1448" class="sentence">17  Show me a sign of your goodness,So that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame.
For you, O Jehovah, are my helper and comforter.</span></p></level1>
