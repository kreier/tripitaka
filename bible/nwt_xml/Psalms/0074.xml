<level1><h1 id="p1183">Psalm 74 A masʹkil. Of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p1184" class="sentence">Why, O God, have you rejected us forever?
Why does your anger burn against the flock of your pasture?</span>
<span id="p1185" class="sentence">2  Remember the people you acquired long ago,The tribe you redeemed as your inheritance.
Remember Mount Zion, where you have resided.</span>
<span id="p1186" class="sentence">3  Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins.
The enemy has devastated everything in the holy place.</span>
<span id="p1187" class="sentence">4  Your foes roared inside your meeting place.
They have set up their own banners as signs there.</span>
<span id="p1188" class="sentence">5  They were like men wielding axes against a thick forest.</span>
<span id="p1189" class="sentence">6  They broke up all its engravings with axes and iron bars.</span>
<span id="p1190" class="sentence">7  They set your sanctuary on fire.
They profaned the tabernacle bearing your name, casting it to the ground.</span>
<span id="p1191" class="sentence">8  They and their offspring have said in their hearts:
“All the meeting places of God in the land must be burned.”</span>
<span id="p1192" class="sentence">9  There are no signs for us to see;There is no longer any prophet,And no one among us knows how long this will last.</span>
<span id="p1193" class="sentence">10  How long, O God, will the adversary keep taunting?
Will the enemy treat your name with disrespect forever?</span>
<span id="p1194" class="sentence">11  Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
Draw it out of your bosom and put an end to them.</span>
<span id="p1195" class="sentence">12  But God is my King from long ago,The one performing acts of salvation on the earth.</span>
<span id="p1196" class="sentence">13  You stirred up the sea with your strength;You smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.</span>
<span id="p1197" class="sentence">14  You crushed the heads of Le·viʹa·than;You gave it as food to the people, to those inhabiting the deserts.</span>
<span id="p1198" class="sentence">15  You cut openings for the springs and the streams;You dried up ever-flowing rivers.</span>
<span id="p1199" class="sentence">16  The day belongs to you, also the night.
You made the light and the sun.</span>
<span id="p1200" class="sentence">17  You set up all the boundaries of the earth;You made summer and winter.</span>
<span id="p1201" class="sentence">18  Remember the enemy’s taunts, O Jehovah,How a foolish people treats your name with disrespect.</span>
<span id="p1202" class="sentence">19  Do not surrender the life of your turtledove to the wild beasts.
Do not forget the life of your afflicted people forever.</span>
<span id="p1203" class="sentence">20  Remember the covenant,For the dark places of the earth have become full of the haunts of violence.</span>
<span id="p1204" class="sentence">21  May the crushed one not turn away disappointed;May the lowly and the poor praise your name.</span>
<span id="p1205" class="sentence">22  Rise up, O God, and plead your legal case.
Remember how the foolish taunt you all day long.</span>
<span id="p1206" class="sentence">23  Do not forget what your foes are saying.
The uproar of those who defy you is ascending constantly.</span></p></level1>
