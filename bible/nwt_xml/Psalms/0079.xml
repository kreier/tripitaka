<level1><h1 id="p1325">Psalm 79 A melody of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p1326" class="sentence">O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;They have defiled your holy temple;They have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins.</span>
<span id="p1327" class="sentence">2  They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the heavensAnd the flesh of your loyal ones to the wild beasts of the earth.</span>
<span id="p1328" class="sentence">3  They have poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem,And no one is left to bury them.</span>
<span id="p1329" class="sentence">4  We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors;Those around us ridicule and jeer us.</span>
<span id="p1330" class="sentence">5  How long, O Jehovah, will you be furious? Forever?
How long will your indignation burn just like fire?</span>
<span id="p1331" class="sentence">6  Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know youAnd on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.</span>
<span id="p1332" class="sentence">7  For they have devoured JacobAnd have desolated his homeland.</span>
<span id="p1333" class="sentence">8  Do not hold us accountable for the errors of our ancestors.
Quickly show us your mercy,For we have been brought very low.</span>
<span id="p1334" class="sentence">9  Help us, O God of our salvation,For the sake of your glorious name;Rescue us and forgive our sins for the sake of your name.</span>
<span id="p1335" class="sentence">10  Why should the nations say: “Where is their God?”
Before our eyes may it become known among the nationsThat the shed blood of your servants has been avenged.</span>
<span id="p1336" class="sentence">11  May you hear the sighing of the prisoner.
Use your great power to preserve those sentenced to death.</span>
<span id="p1337" class="sentence">12  Repay our neighbors sevenfoldFor the taunts they have leveled at you, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1338" class="sentence">13  Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture,Will give thanks to you forever;And we will declare your praise from generation to generation.</span></p></level1>
