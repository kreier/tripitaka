<level1><h1 id="p779">Psalm 50 A melody of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p780" class="sentence">The God of gods, Jehovah, has spoken;He summons the earthFrom the rising of the sun until its setting.</span>
<span id="p781" class="sentence">2  Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.</span>
<span id="p782" class="sentence">3  Our God will come and cannot remain silent.
Before him is a consuming fire,And a great storm rages all around him.</span>
<span id="p783" class="sentence">4  He summons the heavens above and the earth,So as to judge his people:</span>
<span id="p784" class="sentence">5  “Gather to me my loyal ones,Those making a covenant with me over sacrifice.”</span>
<span id="p785" class="sentence">6  The heavens proclaim his righteousness,For God himself is Judge. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p786" class="sentence">7  “Listen, O my people, and I will speak;Israel, I will bear witness against you.
I am God, your God.</span>
<span id="p787" class="sentence">8  I do not reprove you because of your sacrifices,Nor because of your whole burnt offerings that are constantly before me.</span>
<span id="p788" class="sentence">9  I do not need to take a bull from your house,Nor goats from your pens.</span>
<span id="p789" class="sentence">10  For every wild animal of the forest is mine,Even the beasts upon a thousand mountains.</span>
<span id="p790" class="sentence">11  I know every bird of the mountains;The countless animals of the field are mine.</span>
<span id="p791" class="sentence">12  If I were hungry, I would not tell you,For the productive land and everything in it is mine.</span>
<span id="p792" class="sentence">13  Will I eat the flesh of bullsAnd drink the blood of goats?</span>
<span id="p793" class="sentence">14  Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God,And pay your vows to the Most High;</span>
<span id="p794" class="sentence">15  Call on me in the time of distress.
I will rescue you, and you will glorify me.”</span>
<span id="p795" class="sentence">16  But God will say to the wicked:
“What right do you have to relate my regulationsOr to speak about my covenant?</span>
<span id="p796" class="sentence">17  For you hate discipline,And you keep turning your back on my words.</span>
<span id="p797" class="sentence">18  When you see a thief, you approve of him,And you keep company with adulterers.</span>
<span id="p798" class="sentence">19  You use your mouth to spread what is bad,And deception is attached to your tongue.</span>
<span id="p799" class="sentence">20  You sit and speak against your own brother;You reveal the faults of your own mother’s son.</span>
<span id="p800" class="sentence">21  When you did these things, I remained silent,So you thought that I would be just like you.
But now I will reprove you,And I will state my case against you.</span>
<span id="p801" class="sentence">22  Please consider this, you who forget God,So that I may not tear you to pieces with no one to rescue you.</span>
<span id="p802" class="sentence">23  The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me,And as for the one who follows a set course,I will cause him to see salvation by God.”</span></p></level1>
