<level1><h1 id="p1610">Psalm 95</h1>
<p><span id="p1611" class="sentence">Come, let us shout joyfully to Jehovah!
Let us shout in triumph to our Rock of salvation.</span>
<span id="p1612" class="sentence">2  Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;Let us sing and shout in triumph to him.</span>
<span id="p1613" class="sentence">3  For Jehovah is a great God,A great King over all other gods.</span>
<span id="p1614" class="sentence">4  In his hand are the depths of the earth;The mountain peaks belong to him.</span>
<span id="p1615" class="sentence">5  The sea, which he made, belongs to him,And his hands formed the dry land.</span>
<span id="p1616" class="sentence">6  Come, let us worship and bow down;Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.</span>
<span id="p1617" class="sentence">7  For he is our God,And we are the people of his pasture,The sheep in his care.
Today if you listen to his voice,</span>
<span id="p1618" class="sentence">8  Do not harden your heart as at Merʹi·bah,As in the day of Masʹsah in the wilderness,</span>
<span id="p1619" class="sentence">9  When your forefathers tested me;They challenged me, though they had seen my works.</span>
<span id="p1620" class="sentence">10  For 40 years I felt a loathing toward that generation, and I said:
“They are a people who always go astray in their hearts;They have not come to know my ways.”</span>
<span id="p1621" class="sentence">11  So I swore in my anger:
“They will not enter into my rest.”</span></p></level1>
