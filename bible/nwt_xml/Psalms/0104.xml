<level1><h1 id="p1736">Psalm 104</h1>
<p><span id="p1737" class="sentence">Let me praise Jehovah.
O Jehovah my God, you are very great.
With majesty and splendor you are clothed.</span>
<span id="p1738" class="sentence">2  You are wrapped in light as with a garment;You stretch out the heavens like a tent cloth.</span>
<span id="p1739" class="sentence">3  He lays beams of his upper rooms in the waters above,Making the clouds his chariot,Moving on the wings of the wind.</span>
<span id="p1740" class="sentence">4  He makes his angels spirits,His ministers a consuming fire.</span>
<span id="p1741" class="sentence">5  He has established the earth on its foundations;It will not be moved from its place forever and ever.</span>
<span id="p1742" class="sentence">6  You covered it with deep waters as with a garment.
The waters stood above the mountains.</span>
<span id="p1743" class="sentence">7  At your rebuke they fled;At the sound of your thunder they ran away in panic</span>
<span id="p1744" class="sentence">8  —Mountains ascended and valleys descended—To the place you established for them.</span>
<span id="p1745" class="sentence">9  You set a boundary that they should not pass,That they should never again cover the earth.</span>
<span id="p1746" class="sentence">10  He sends springs into the valleys;Between the mountains they flow.</span>
<span id="p1747" class="sentence">11  They provide water for all the wild beasts of the field;The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span>
<span id="p1748" class="sentence">12  Above them roost the birds of the sky;They sing among the thick foliage.</span>
<span id="p1749" class="sentence">13  He is watering the mountains from his upper rooms.
With the fruitage of your works the earth is satisfied.</span>
<span id="p1750" class="sentence">14  He is making grass grow for the cattleAnd vegetation for mankind’s use,To grow food from the land</span>
<span id="p1751" class="sentence">15  And wine that makes man’s heart rejoice,Oil that makes the face shine,And bread that sustains the heart of mortal man.</span>
<span id="p1752" class="sentence">16  The trees of Jehovah are satisfied,The cedars of Lebʹa·non that he planted,</span>
<span id="p1753" class="sentence">17  Where the birds make nests.
The home of the stork is in the juniper trees.</span>
<span id="p1754" class="sentence">18  The high mountains are for the mountain goats;The crags are a refuge for the rock badgers.</span>
<span id="p1755" class="sentence">19  He has made the moon to mark the appointed times;The sun well knows when to set.</span>
<span id="p1756" class="sentence">20  You bring darkness, and night falls,When all the wild animals of the forest roam about.</span>
<span id="p1757" class="sentence">21  The young lions roar for their preyAnd seek their food from God.</span>
<span id="p1758" class="sentence">22  When the sun rises,They withdraw and lie down in their dens.</span>
<span id="p1759" class="sentence">23  Man goes to his work,And he labors until evening.</span>
<span id="p1760" class="sentence">24  How many your works are, O Jehovah!
You have made all of them in wisdom.
The earth is full of what you have made.</span>
<span id="p1761" class="sentence">25  There is the sea, so great and wide,Teeming with countless living things, both small and great.</span>
<span id="p1762" class="sentence">26  There the ships travel,And Le·viʹa·than, which you formed to play in it.</span>
<span id="p1763" class="sentence">27  All of them wait for youTo give them their food in its season.</span>
<span id="p1764" class="sentence">28  What you give them, they gather.
When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</span>
<span id="p1765" class="sentence">29  When you hide your face, they are disturbed.
If you take away their spirit, they die and return to the dust.</span>
<span id="p1766" class="sentence">30  If you send out your spirit, they are created,And you renew the surface of the ground.</span>
<span id="p1767" class="sentence">31  The glory of Jehovah will last forever.
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.</span>
<span id="p1768" class="sentence">32  He looks at the earth, and it trembles;He touches the mountains, and they smoke.</span>
<span id="p1769" class="sentence">33  I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life;I will sing praises to my God as long as I live.</span>
<span id="p1770" class="sentence">34  Let my thoughts be pleasing to him.
I will rejoice in Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1771" class="sentence">35  The sinners will vanish from the earth,And the wicked will no longer exist.
Let me praise Jehovah. Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
