<level1><h1 id="p410">Psalm 30 A melody. A song of inauguration of the house. Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p411" class="sentence">I will exalt you, O Jehovah, for you have lifted me up;You did not let my enemies rejoice over me.</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">2  O Jehovah my God, I cried to you for help, and you healed me.</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">3  O Jehovah, you have lifted me up from the Grave.
You kept me alive; you spared me from sinking into the pit.</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">4  Sing praises to Jehovah, you his loyal ones,Give thanks to his holy name;</span>
<span id="p415" class="sentence">5  Because being under his anger is only for a moment,But being in his favor is for a lifetime.
Weeping may come in the evening, but in the morning, there is a joyful cry.</span>
<span id="p416" class="sentence">6  When I was untroubled, I said:
“I will never be shaken.”</span>
<span id="p417" class="sentence">7  O Jehovah, while I was in your favor, you made me as strong as a mountain.
But when you hid your face, I became terrified.</span>
<span id="p418" class="sentence">8  To you, O Jehovah, I kept calling;And to Jehovah, I kept pleading for favor.</span>
<span id="p419" class="sentence">9  What profit is there in my death, in my going down to the pit?
Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?</span>
<span id="p420" class="sentence">10  Hear, O Jehovah, and show me favor.
O Jehovah, become my helper.</span>
<span id="p421" class="sentence">11  You have changed my mourning into dancing;You have removed my sackcloth, and you clothe me with rejoicing,</span>
<span id="p422" class="sentence">12  So that I may sing your praise and not keep silent.
O Jehovah my God, I will praise you forever.</span></p></level1>
