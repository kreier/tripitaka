<level1><h1 id="p872">Psalm 56 To the director; set to “The Silent Dove That Is Far Away.” Of David. Mikʹtam. When the Phi·lisʹtines captured him in Gath.</h1>
<p><span id="p873" class="sentence">Show me favor, O God, because mortal man is attacking me.
All day long they keep fighting and oppressing me.</span>
<span id="p874" class="sentence">2  My foes keep snapping at me all day long;Many arrogantly fight against me.</span>
<span id="p875" class="sentence">3  When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.</span>
<span id="p876" class="sentence">4  In God—whose word I praise—In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.
What can mere man do to me?</span>
<span id="p877" class="sentence">5  All day long they hurt my interests;Their only thought is to harm me.</span>
<span id="p878" class="sentence">6  They conceal themselves to attack;They watch my every step,Hoping to take away my life.</span>
<span id="p879" class="sentence">7  Reject them because of their wickedness.
Bring down the nations in your anger, O God.</span>
<span id="p880" class="sentence">8  You keep track of my wandering.
Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.
Are they not recorded in your book?</span>
<span id="p881" class="sentence">9  My enemies will retreat on the day that I call for help.
Of this I am confident: God is on my side.</span>
<span id="p882" class="sentence">10  In God—whose word I praise—In Jehovah—whose word I praise—</span>
<span id="p883" class="sentence">11  In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.
What can a mere human do to me?</span>
<span id="p884" class="sentence">12  I am bound by my vows to you, O God;I will offer you expressions of thanksgiving.</span>
<span id="p885" class="sentence">13  For you have rescued me from deathAnd prevented my feet from stumbling,So that I may walk before God in the light of the living.</span></p></level1>
