<level1><h1 id="p1476">Psalm 89 Masʹkil. Of Eʹthan the Ezʹra·hite.</h1>
<p><span id="p1477" class="sentence">I will sing about Jehovah’s expressions of loyal love forever.
With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</span>
<span id="p1478" class="sentence">2  For I have said: “Loyal love will be built up forever,And you have firmly established your faithfulness in the heavens.”</span>
<span id="p1479" class="sentence">3  “I have made a covenant with my chosen one;I have sworn to David my servant:</span>
<span id="p1480" class="sentence">4  ‘I will firmly establish your offspring forever,And I will build up your throne for all generations.’” (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1481" class="sentence">5  The heavens praise your marvels, O Jehovah,Yes, your faithfulness in the congregation of the holy ones.</span>
<span id="p1482" class="sentence">6  For who in the skies can compare to Jehovah?
Who among the sons of God is like Jehovah?</span>
<span id="p1483" class="sentence">7  God is held in awe in the council of holy ones;He is grand and awe-inspiring to all who are around him.</span>
<span id="p1484" class="sentence">8  O Jehovah God of armies,Who is mighty like you, O Jah?
Your faithfulness surrounds you.</span>
<span id="p1485" class="sentence">9  You rule over the raging of the sea;When its waves surge, you calm them.</span>
<span id="p1486" class="sentence">10  You have crushed Raʹhab like one who is slain.
With your strong arm you have scattered your enemies.</span>
<span id="p1487" class="sentence">11  The heavens are yours, and the earth is yours;The productive land and what fills it—you have founded them.</span>
<span id="p1488" class="sentence">12  The north and the south—you created them;Taʹbor and Herʹmon joyously praise your name.</span>
<span id="p1489" class="sentence">13  Your arm is mighty;Your hand is strong;Your right hand is exalted.</span>
<span id="p1490" class="sentence">14  Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;Loyal love and faithfulness stand before you.</span>
<span id="p1491" class="sentence">15  Happy are the people who know the joyful shouting.
O Jehovah, they walk in the light of your face.</span>
<span id="p1492" class="sentence">16  They rejoice in your name all day long,And in your righteousness they are exalted.</span>
<span id="p1493" class="sentence">17  For you are the glory of their strength,And by your approval our strength is exalted.</span>
<span id="p1494" class="sentence">18  For our shield belongs to Jehovah,Our king belongs to the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1495" class="sentence">19  At that time you spoke in a vision to your loyal ones and said:
“I have granted strength to a mighty one;I have exalted a chosen one from among the people.</span>
<span id="p1496" class="sentence">20  I have found David my servant;With my holy oil I have anointed him.</span>
<span id="p1497" class="sentence">21  My hand will support him,And my arm will strengthen him.</span>
<span id="p1498" class="sentence">22  No enemy will exact tribute from him,And no unrighteous man will oppress him.</span>
<span id="p1499" class="sentence">23  I will crush to pieces his adversaries from before himAnd strike down those who hate him.</span>
<span id="p1500" class="sentence">24  My faithfulness and loyal love are with him,And in my name his strength will be exalted.</span>
<span id="p1501" class="sentence">25  I will put his hand over the seaAnd his right hand over the rivers.</span>
<span id="p1502" class="sentence">26  He will call out to me: ‘You are my Father,My God and the Rock of my salvation.’</span>
<span id="p1503" class="sentence">27  And I will place him as firstborn,The highest of the kings of the earth.</span>
<span id="p1504" class="sentence">28  I will maintain my loyal love for him forever,And my covenant with him will never fail.</span>
<span id="p1505" class="sentence">29  I will establish his offspring foreverAnd make his throne as enduring as the heavens.</span>
<span id="p1506" class="sentence">30  If his sons leave my lawAnd do not walk according to my decrees,</span>
<span id="p1507" class="sentence">31  If they violate my statutesAnd do not keep my commandments,</span>
<span id="p1508" class="sentence">32  Then I will punish their disobedience with a rodAnd their error with flogging.</span>
<span id="p1509" class="sentence">33  But I will never abandon my loyal love for himNor be untrue to my promise.</span>
<span id="p1510" class="sentence">34  I will not violate my covenantOr change what my lips have spoken.</span>
<span id="p1511" class="sentence">35  I have sworn in my holiness, once and for all;I will not tell lies to David.</span>
<span id="p1512" class="sentence">36  His offspring will endure forever;His throne will endure like the sun before me.</span>
<span id="p1513" class="sentence">37  Like the moon, it will be firmly established foreverAs a faithful witness in the skies.” (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1514" class="sentence">38  But you yourself have cast off and rejected him;You have become furious with your anointed one.</span>
<span id="p1515" class="sentence">39  You have spurned the covenant with your servant;You have profaned his crown by throwing it to the ground.</span>
<span id="p1516" class="sentence">40  You have broken down all his stone walls;You have reduced his fortifications to ruins.</span>
<span id="p1517" class="sentence">41  All who pass by have pillaged him;He is a reproach to his neighbors.</span>
<span id="p1518" class="sentence">42  You have made his adversaries victorious;You have caused all his enemies to rejoice.</span>
<span id="p1519" class="sentence">43  You have also driven back his sword,And you have made him lose ground in the battle.</span>
<span id="p1520" class="sentence">44  You have brought an end to his splendorAnd hurled his throne to the ground.</span>
<span id="p1521" class="sentence">45  You have cut short the days of his youth;You have clothed him with shame. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1522" class="sentence">46  How long, O Jehovah, will you hide yourself? Will it be forever?
Will your rage continue to burn like a fire?</span>
<span id="p1523" class="sentence">47  Remember how short my life is!
Was it to no purpose that you created all humans?</span>
<span id="p1524" class="sentence">48  What man can live and never see death?
Can he save himself from the power of the Grave? (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1525" class="sentence">49  Where are your former acts of loyal love, O Jehovah,That you swore about to David in your faithfulness?</span>
<span id="p1526" class="sentence">50  Remember, O Jehovah, the taunts hurled at your servants;How I have to bear the taunts of all the peoples;</span>
<span id="p1527" class="sentence">51  How your enemies have hurled insults, O Jehovah;How they have insulted every footstep of your anointed one.</span>
<span id="p1528" class="sentence">52  May Jehovah be praised forever. Amen and Amen.</span></p></level1>
