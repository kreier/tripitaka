<level1><h1 id="p2006">Psalm 115</h1>
<p><span id="p2007" class="sentence">Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us,But to your name give gloryBecause of your loyal love and your faithfulness.</span>
<span id="p2008" class="sentence">2  Why should the nations say:
“Where is their God?”</span>
<span id="p2009" class="sentence">3  Our God is in the heavens;He does whatever he pleases.</span>
<span id="p2010" class="sentence">4  Their idols are silver and gold,The work of human hands.</span>
<span id="p2011" class="sentence">5  A mouth they have, but they cannot speak;Eyes, but they cannot see;</span>
<span id="p2012" class="sentence">6  Ears they have, but they cannot hear;A nose, but they cannot smell;</span>
<span id="p2013" class="sentence">7  Hands they have, but they cannot feel;Feet, but they cannot walk;They make no sound with their throat.</span>
<span id="p2014" class="sentence">8  The people who make them will become just like them,As will all those who trust in them.</span>
<span id="p2015" class="sentence">9  O Israel, trust in Jehovah—He is their help and their shield.</span>
<span id="p2016" class="sentence">10  O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah—He is their help and their shield.</span>
<span id="p2017" class="sentence">11  You who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah—He is their help and their shield.</span>
<span id="p2018" class="sentence">12  Jehovah remembers us and will bless;He will bless the house of Israel;He will bless the house of Aaron.</span>
<span id="p2019" class="sentence">13  He will bless those who fear Jehovah,The small as well as the great.</span>
<span id="p2020" class="sentence">14  Jehovah will give you an increase,To you and your children.</span>
<span id="p2021" class="sentence">15  May you be blessed by Jehovah,The Maker of heaven and earth.</span>
<span id="p2022" class="sentence">16  As for the heavens, they belong to Jehovah,But the earth he has given to the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p2023" class="sentence">17  The dead do not praise Jah;Nor do any who go down into the silence of death.</span>
<span id="p2024" class="sentence">18  But we will praise JahFrom now on and forever.
Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
