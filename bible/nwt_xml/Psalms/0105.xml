<level1><h1 id="p1772">Psalm 105</h1>
<p><span id="p1773" class="sentence">Give thanks to Jehovah, call on his name,Make his deeds known among the peoples!</span>
<span id="p1774" class="sentence">2  Sing to him, sing praises to him,Ponder over all his wonderful works.</span>
<span id="p1775" class="sentence">3  Boast about his holy name.
Let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.</span>
<span id="p1776" class="sentence">4  Search for Jehovah and his strength.
Seek his face constantly.</span>
<span id="p1777" class="sentence">5  Remember the wonderful works he has performed,His miracles and the judgments he has pronounced,</span>
<span id="p1778" class="sentence">6  You offspring of Abraham his servant,You sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span>
<span id="p1779" class="sentence">7  He is Jehovah our God.
His judgments are throughout the earth.</span>
<span id="p1780" class="sentence">8  He remembers his covenant forever,The promise he made, to a thousand generations,</span>
<span id="p1781" class="sentence">9  The covenant he made with Abraham,And the oath he swore to Isaac,</span>
<span id="p1782" class="sentence">10  Which he established as a decree to JacobAnd as a lasting covenant to Israel,</span>
<span id="p1783" class="sentence">11  Saying, “I will give you the land of CaʹnaanAs your allotted inheritance.”</span>
<span id="p1784" class="sentence">12  This was when they were few in number,Yes, very few, and they were foreigners in the land.</span>
<span id="p1785" class="sentence">13  They walked about from nation to nation,From one kingdom to another people.</span>
<span id="p1786" class="sentence">14  He did not allow any man to oppress them,But on their account he reproved kings,</span>
<span id="p1787" class="sentence">15  Saying, “Do not touch my anointed ones,And to my prophets do nothing bad.”</span>
<span id="p1788" class="sentence">16  He called down a famine on the land;He cut off their supply of bread.</span>
<span id="p1789" class="sentence">17  He sent ahead of them a manWho was sold to be a slave, Joseph.</span>
<span id="p1790" class="sentence">18  With fetters they bound his feet,His neck was put in irons;</span>
<span id="p1791" class="sentence">19  Until the time that his word proved true,The saying of Jehovah is what refined him.</span>
<span id="p1792" class="sentence">20  The king sent to release him,The ruler of the peoples set him free.</span>
<span id="p1793" class="sentence">21  He made him master of his household,Ruler over all his property,</span>
<span id="p1794" class="sentence">22  To have authority over his princes as he pleasedAnd to teach his elders wisdom.</span>
<span id="p1795" class="sentence">23  Then Israel came into Egypt,And Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.</span>
<span id="p1796" class="sentence">24  God made his people very fruitful;He made them mightier than their adversaries,</span>
<span id="p1797" class="sentence">25  Whose hearts he let change to hate his people,To plot against his servants.</span>
<span id="p1798" class="sentence">26  He sent his servant Moses,And Aaron, whom he had chosen.</span>
<span id="p1799" class="sentence">27  They performed his signs among them,His miracles in the land of Ham.</span>
<span id="p1800" class="sentence">28  He sent darkness and the land became dark;They did not rebel against his words.</span>
<span id="p1801" class="sentence">29  He changed their waters into bloodAnd killed their fish.</span>
<span id="p1802" class="sentence">30  Their land swarmed with frogs,Even in the royal chambers.</span>
<span id="p1803" class="sentence">31  He ordered the gadflies to invadeAnd gnats in all their territories.</span>
<span id="p1804" class="sentence">32  He turned their rain to hailAnd sent lightning on their land.</span>
<span id="p1805" class="sentence">33  He struck their vines and their fig treesAnd shattered the trees of their territory.</span>
<span id="p1806" class="sentence">34  He said that the locusts should invade,Young locusts without number.</span>
<span id="p1807" class="sentence">35  They devoured all the vegetation in the land,And they devoured the produce of the ground.</span>
<span id="p1808" class="sentence">36  Then he struck down every firstborn in their land,The beginning of their procreative power.</span>
<span id="p1809" class="sentence">37  He brought his people out with silver and gold;And no one among his tribes stumbled.</span>
<span id="p1810" class="sentence">38  Egypt rejoiced when they left,For the dread of Israel had fallen on them.</span>
<span id="p1811" class="sentence">39  He spread a cloud to screen them off
And fire to give light by night.</span>
<span id="p1812" class="sentence">40  They asked, and he brought quail;He kept satisfying them with bread from heaven.</span>
<span id="p1813" class="sentence">41  He opened a rock, and waters flowed out;These flowed through the desert like a river.</span>
<span id="p1814" class="sentence">42  For he remembered the holy promise he had made to Abraham his servant.</span>
<span id="p1815" class="sentence">43  So he brought out his people with exultation,His chosen ones with a joyful cry.</span>
<span id="p1816" class="sentence">44  He gave them the lands of nations;They inherited what other peoples had worked hard to produce,</span>
<span id="p1817" class="sentence">45  So that they would keep his decreesAnd observe his laws.
Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
