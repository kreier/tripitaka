<level1><h1 id="p848">Psalm 55 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. Masʹkil. Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p849" class="sentence">Listen to my prayer, O God,And do not ignore my request for mercy.</span>
<span id="p850" class="sentence">2  Do pay attention to me and answer me.
My concern makes me restless,And I am distraught</span>
<span id="p851" class="sentence">3  Because of what the enemy is sayingAnd the pressure from the wicked one.
For they heap trouble upon me,And in anger they harbor animosity against me.</span>
<span id="p852" class="sentence">4  My heart is in anguish within me,And the terrors of death overwhelm me.</span>
<span id="p853" class="sentence">5  Fear and trembling come upon me,And shuddering grips me.</span>
<span id="p854" class="sentence">6  I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and reside in safety.</span>
<span id="p855" class="sentence">7  Look! I would flee far away.
I would lodge in the wilderness. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p856" class="sentence">8  I would hurry to a place of shelterAway from the raging wind, away from the storm.”</span>
<span id="p857" class="sentence">9  Confuse them, O Jehovah, and frustrate their plans,For I have seen violence and conflict in the city.</span>
<span id="p858" class="sentence">10  Day and night they walk around on its walls;Within it are malice and trouble.</span>
<span id="p859" class="sentence">11  Ruin is in its midst;Oppression and deception never depart from its public square.</span>
<span id="p860" class="sentence">12  For it is not an enemy who taunts me;Otherwise I could put up with it.
It is not a foe who has risen up against me;Otherwise I could conceal myself from him.</span>
<span id="p861" class="sentence">13  But it is you, a man like me,My own companion whom I know well.</span>
<span id="p862" class="sentence">14  We used to enjoy a warm friendship together;Into the house of God we used to walk along with the multitude.</span>
<span id="p863" class="sentence">15  May destruction overtake them!
Let them go down alive into the Grave;For evil resides among them and within them.</span>
<span id="p864" class="sentence">16  As for me, I will call out to God,And Jehovah will save me.</span>
<span id="p865" class="sentence">17  Evening and morning and noontime, I am troubled and I groan,And he hears my voice.</span>
<span id="p866" class="sentence">18  He will rescue me and give me peace from those fighting against me,For multitudes come against me.</span>
<span id="p867" class="sentence">19  God will hear and respond to them,The one who sits enthroned from of old. (Selah)
They will refuse to change,Those who have not feared God.</span>
<span id="p868" class="sentence">20  He attacked those at peace with him;He violated his covenant.</span>
<span id="p869" class="sentence">21  His words are smoother than butter,But conflict is in his heart.
His words are softer than oil,But they are drawn swords.</span>
<span id="p870" class="sentence">22  Throw your burden on Jehovah,And he will sustain you.
Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.</span>
<span id="p871" class="sentence">23  But you, O God, will bring them down to the deepest pit.
Those bloodguilty and deceitful men will not live out half their days.
But as for me, I will trust in you.</span></p></level1>
