<level1><h1 id="p483">Psalm 34 Of David, when he disguised his sanity before A·bimʹe·lech, who drove him away, and he left.</h1>
<p><span id="p484" class="sentence">I will praise Jehovah at all times;His praise will be on my lips constantly.</span>
<span id="p485" class="sentence">2  I will boast in Jehovah;The meek will hear and rejoice.</span>
<span id="p486" class="sentence">3  Magnify Jehovah along with me;Let us exalt his name together.</span>
<span id="p487" class="sentence">4  I inquired of Jehovah, and he answered me.
He rescued me from all my fears.</span>
<span id="p488" class="sentence">5  Those who looked to him became radiant;Their faces could not be put to shame.</span>
<span id="p489" class="sentence">6  This lowly one called, and Jehovah heard.
He saved him from all his distresses.</span>
<span id="p490" class="sentence">7  The angel of Jehovah camps all around those fearing Him,And he rescues them.</span>
<span id="p491" class="sentence">8  Taste and see that Jehovah is good;Happy is the man who takes refuge in him.</span>
<span id="p492" class="sentence">9  Fear Jehovah, all you his holy ones,For those who fear him lack nothing.</span>
<span id="p493" class="sentence">10  Even strong young lions have been reduced to hunger,But those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.</span>
<span id="p494" class="sentence">11  Come, my sons, listen to me;I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p495" class="sentence">12  Who among you takes pleasure in lifeAnd would love to see many good days?</span>
<span id="p496" class="sentence">13  Then guard your tongue from what is bad,Your lips from speaking deception.</span>
<span id="p497" class="sentence">14  Turn away from what is bad and do what is good;Seek peace and pursue it.</span>
<span id="p498" class="sentence">15  The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous,And his ears listen to their cry for help.</span>
<span id="p499" class="sentence">16  But the face of Jehovah is against those doing what is bad,To erase all memory of them from the earth.</span>
<span id="p500" class="sentence">17  They cried out, and Jehovah heard;He rescued them from all their distresses.</span>
<span id="p501" class="sentence">18  Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;He saves those who are crushed in spirit.</span>
<span id="p502" class="sentence">19  Many are the hardships of the righteous one,But Jehovah rescues him from them all.</span>
<span id="p503" class="sentence">20  He is guarding all his bones;Not one of them has been broken.</span>
<span id="p504" class="sentence">21  Disaster will put the wicked to death;Those hating the righteous will be found guilty.</span>
<span id="p505" class="sentence">22  Jehovah is redeeming the life of his servants;None of those taking refuge in him will be found guilty.</span></p></level1>
