<level1><h1 id="p2548">Psalm 146</h1>
<p><span id="p2549" class="sentence">Praise Jah!
Let my whole being praise Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p2550" class="sentence">2  I will praise Jehovah all my life.
I will sing praises to my God as long as I live.</span>
<span id="p2551" class="sentence">3  Do not put your trust in princesNor in a son of man, who cannot bring salvation.</span>
<span id="p2552" class="sentence">4  His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground;On that very day his thoughts perish.</span>
<span id="p2553" class="sentence">5  Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob as his helper,Whose hope is in Jehovah his God,</span>
<span id="p2554" class="sentence">6  The Maker of heaven and earth,Of the sea, and of all that is in them,The One who always remains faithful,</span>
<span id="p2555" class="sentence">7  The One securing justice for those defrauded,The One giving bread to the hungry.
Jehovah is releasing the prisoners.</span>
<span id="p2556" class="sentence">8  Jehovah is opening the eyes of the blind;Jehovah is raising up those bowed down;Jehovah loves the righteous.</span>
<span id="p2557" class="sentence">9  Jehovah is protecting the foreign residents;He sustains the fatherless child and the widow,But he thwarts the plans of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p2558" class="sentence">10  Jehovah will be King forever,Your God, O Zion, for generation after generation.
Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
