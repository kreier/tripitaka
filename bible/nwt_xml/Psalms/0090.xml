<level1><h1 id="p1529">Psalm 90 A prayer of Moses, the man of the true God.</h1>
<p><span id="p1530" class="sentence">O Jehovah, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.</span>
<span id="p1531" class="sentence">2  Before the mountains were bornOr you brought forth the earth and the productive land,From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.</span>
<span id="p1532" class="sentence">3  You make mortal man return to dust;You say: “Return, you sons of men.”</span>
<span id="p1533" class="sentence">4  For a thousand years are in your eyes just as yesterday when it is past,Just as a watch during the night.</span>
<span id="p1534" class="sentence">5  You sweep them away; they become like mere sleep;In the morning they are like grass that sprouts.</span>
<span id="p1535" class="sentence">6  In the morning it blossoms and is renewed,But by evening it withers and dries up.</span>
<span id="p1536" class="sentence">7  For we are consumed by your angerAnd terrified by your rage.</span>
<span id="p1537" class="sentence">8  You place our errors in front of you;Our secrets are exposed by the light of your face.</span>
<span id="p1538" class="sentence">9  Our days ebb away because of your fury;And our years come to an end like a whisper.</span>
<span id="p1539" class="sentence">10  The span of our life is 70 years,Or 80 if one is especially strong.
But they are filled with trouble and sorrow;They quickly pass by, and away we fly.</span>
<span id="p1540" class="sentence">11  Who can fathom the power of your anger?
Your fury is as great as the fear you deserve.</span>
<span id="p1541" class="sentence">12  Teach us how to count our daysSo that we may acquire a heart of wisdom.</span>
<span id="p1542" class="sentence">13  Return, O Jehovah! How long will this last?
Have pity on your servants.</span>
<span id="p1543" class="sentence">14  Satisfy us with your loyal love in the morning,So that we may shout joyfully and rejoice during all our days.</span>
<span id="p1544" class="sentence">15  Make us rejoice in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,For as many years as we have experienced calamity.</span>
<span id="p1545" class="sentence">16  May your servants see your activity,And may their sons see your splendor.</span>
<span id="p1546" class="sentence">17  May the favor of Jehovah our God be upon us;May you prosper the work of our hands.
Yes, prosper the work of our hands.</span></p></level1>
