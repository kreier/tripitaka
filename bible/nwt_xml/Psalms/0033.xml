<level1><h1 id="p460">Psalm 33</h1>
<p><span id="p461" class="sentence">Shout joyfully, you righteous ones, because of Jehovah.
It is fitting for the upright to praise him.</span>
<span id="p462" class="sentence">2  Give thanks to Jehovah with the harp;Sing praises to him with a ten-stringed instrument.</span>
<span id="p463" class="sentence">3  Sing to him a new song;Play skillfully on the strings, along with shouts of joy.</span>
<span id="p464" class="sentence">4  For the word of Jehovah is upright,And everything he does is trustworthy.</span>
<span id="p465" class="sentence">5  He loves righteousness and justice.
The earth is filled with Jehovah’s loyal love.</span>
<span id="p466" class="sentence">6  By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made,And by the spirit of his mouth everything in them.</span>
<span id="p467" class="sentence">7  He gathers the seawaters like a dam;He puts the surging waters in storehouses.</span>
<span id="p468" class="sentence">8  Let the whole earth fear Jehovah.
Let the inhabitants of the productive land be in awe of him.</span>
<span id="p469" class="sentence">9  For he spoke, and it came to be;He commanded, and it stood firm.</span>
<span id="p470" class="sentence">10  Jehovah has frustrated the schemes of the nations;He has thwarted the plans of the peoples.</span>
<span id="p471" class="sentence">11  But the decisions of Jehovah will stand forever;The thoughts of his heart are from generation to generation.</span>
<span id="p472" class="sentence">12  Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah,The people he has chosen as his own possession.</span>
<span id="p473" class="sentence">13  Jehovah looks down from heaven;He sees all the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p474" class="sentence">14  From his place of residence,He gazes on the inhabitants of the earth.</span>
<span id="p475" class="sentence">15  He is the one forming the hearts of all;He examines all their works.</span>
<span id="p476" class="sentence">16  No king is saved by a large army;A mighty man is not saved by his great power.</span>
<span id="p477" class="sentence">17  The horse is a false hope for salvation;Its great strength does not ensure escape.</span>
<span id="p478" class="sentence">18  Look! The eye of Jehovah watches over those fearing him,Those waiting for his loyal love,</span>
<span id="p479" class="sentence">19  To rescue them from deathAnd to keep them alive during famine.</span>
<span id="p480" class="sentence">20  We are in expectation of Jehovah.
He is our helper and our shield.</span>
<span id="p481" class="sentence">21  Our hearts rejoice in him,For we trust in his holy name.</span>
<span id="p482" class="sentence">22  May your loyal love rest upon us, O Jehovah,While we keep waiting for you.</span></p></level1>
