<level1><h1 id="p139">Psalm 12 To the director; tuned to Shemʹi·nith. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p140" class="sentence">Save me, O Jehovah, for the loyal one is no more;Faithful people have vanished from among men.</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">2  They speak lies to one another;They flatter with their lips and speak with deceitful hearts.</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">3  Jehovah will cut off all flattering lipsAnd the tongue that makes great boasts,</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">4  Those who say: “We will prevail with our tongues.
We use our lips as we please;Who will be our master?”</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">5  “Because the afflicted are oppressed,Because of the sighing of the poor,I will rise up to act,” says Jehovah.
“I will save them from those who treat them with contempt.”</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">6  The sayings of Jehovah are pure;They are like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times.</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">7  You will guard them, O Jehovah;You will protect each one of them from this generation forever.</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">8  The wicked walk around unrestrainedBecause the sons of men promote depravity.</span></p></level1>
