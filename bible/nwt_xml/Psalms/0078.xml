<level1><h1 id="p1252">Psalm 78 Masʹkil. Of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p1253" class="sentence">Listen, my people, to my law;Incline your ear to the words of my mouth.</span>
<span id="p1254" class="sentence">2  I will open my mouth in a proverb.
I will propound riddles of long ago.</span>
<span id="p1255" class="sentence">3  The things we have heard and know,Which our fathers have related to us,</span>
<span id="p1256" class="sentence">4  We will not hide from their sons;We will relate to the generation to comeThe praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah and his strength,The wonderful things he has done.</span>
<span id="p1257" class="sentence">5  He established a reminder in JacobAnd set a law in Israel;He commanded our forefathersTo make these things known to their children,</span>
<span id="p1258" class="sentence">6  So that the next generation,The children yet to be born, might know them.
They in turn would relate them to their children.</span>
<span id="p1259" class="sentence">7  Then these would put their confidence in God.
They would not forget God’s worksBut would observe his commandments.</span>
<span id="p1260" class="sentence">8  Then they would not be like their forefathers,A stubborn and rebellious generation,A generation whose heart was unsteadyAnd whose spirit was not faithful to God.</span>
<span id="p1261" class="sentence">9  The Eʹphra·im·ites were armed with the bow,But they retreated in the day of battle.</span>
<span id="p1262" class="sentence">10  They did not keep the covenant of GodAnd refused to walk in his law.</span>
<span id="p1263" class="sentence">11  They also forgot what he had done,His wonderful works that he showed them.</span>
<span id="p1264" class="sentence">12  He did marvelous things in the sight of their forefathers,In the land of Egypt, the region of Zoʹan.</span>
<span id="p1265" class="sentence">13  He split the sea to let them pass through,And he made the waters stand up like a dam.</span>
<span id="p1266" class="sentence">14  He led them with a cloud by dayAnd the whole night with the light of a fire.</span>
<span id="p1267" class="sentence">15  He split rocks in the wilderness,He let them drink their fill as if from deep waters.</span>
<span id="p1268" class="sentence">16  He brought streams out of a cragAnd caused waters to flow down like rivers.</span>
<span id="p1269" class="sentence">17  But they continued to sin against himBy rebelling against the Most High in the desert;</span>
<span id="p1270" class="sentence">18  They challenged God in their heartBy demanding food that they craved.</span>
<span id="p1271" class="sentence">19  So they spoke against God,Saying: “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?”</span>
<span id="p1272" class="sentence">20  Look! He struck a rockSo that waters flowed and streams flooded out.
“Can he also give us bread,Or can he provide meat for his people?”</span>
<span id="p1273" class="sentence">21  When Jehovah heard them, he became furious;A fire blazed against Jacob,And his anger flared up against Israel</span>
<span id="p1274" class="sentence">22  Because they did not put faith in God;They did not trust in his ability to save them.</span>
<span id="p1275" class="sentence">23  So he commanded the cloudy skies above,And he opened the doors of heaven.</span>
<span id="p1276" class="sentence">24  He kept raining down manna for them to eat;He gave them the grain of heaven.</span>
<span id="p1277" class="sentence">25  Men ate the bread of mighty ones;He provided enough to satisfy them.</span>
<span id="p1278" class="sentence">26  He stirred up the east wind in the heavensAnd made a south wind blow by his power.</span>
<span id="p1279" class="sentence">27  And he rained down meat on them like dust,Birds like the sand of the seashore.</span>
<span id="p1280" class="sentence">28  He made them fall in the midst of his camp,All around his tents.</span>
<span id="p1281" class="sentence">29  And they ate and gorged themselves;He gave them what they desired.</span>
<span id="p1282" class="sentence">30  But before they fully satisfied their craving,While their food was yet in their mouth,</span>
<span id="p1283" class="sentence">31  God’s wrath flared up against them.
He put to death their strongest men;He brought down the young men of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1284" class="sentence">32  Despite this they sinned even moreAnd did not put faith in his wonderful works.</span>
<span id="p1285" class="sentence">33  So he brought their days to an end as if a mere breath,And their years by sudden terrors.</span>
<span id="p1286" class="sentence">34  But as often as he killed them, they would search for him;They would return and look for God,</span>
<span id="p1287" class="sentence">35  Remembering that God was their RockAnd that the Most High God was their Redeemer.</span>
<span id="p1288" class="sentence">36  But they tried to deceive him with their mouthAnd lied to him with their tongue.</span>
<span id="p1289" class="sentence">37  Their heart was not steadfast toward him;And they were not faithful to his covenant.</span>
<span id="p1290" class="sentence">38  But he was merciful;He would forgive their error and not bring them to ruin.
He often held back his angerInstead of stirring up all his wrath.</span>
<span id="p1291" class="sentence">39  For he remembered that they were flesh,A wind that blows past and does not return.</span>
<span id="p1292" class="sentence">40  How often they rebelled against him in the wildernessAnd made him feel hurt in the desert!</span>
<span id="p1293" class="sentence">41  Again and again they put God to the test,And they grieved the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1294" class="sentence">42  They did not remember his power,The day that he rescued them from the adversary,</span>
<span id="p1295" class="sentence">43  How he displayed his signs in EgyptAnd his miracles in the region of Zoʹan,</span>
<span id="p1296" class="sentence">44  And how he turned the Nile canals into bloodSo that they could not drink from their streams.</span>
<span id="p1297" class="sentence">45  He sent swarms of gadflies to devour themAnd frogs to bring them to ruin.</span>
<span id="p1298" class="sentence">46  He gave their crops to the voracious locusts,The fruit of their labor to the swarming locusts.</span>
<span id="p1299" class="sentence">47  He destroyed their vines with hailAnd their sycamore trees with hailstones.</span>
<span id="p1300" class="sentence">48  He gave their beasts of burden over to the hailAnd their livestock to the lightning bolts.</span>
<span id="p1301" class="sentence">49  He inflicted his burning anger on them,Fury and indignation and distress,Companies of angels bringing calamity.</span>
<span id="p1302" class="sentence">50  He cleared a pathway for his anger.
He did not spare them from death;And he gave them over to pestilence.</span>
<span id="p1303" class="sentence">51  Finally he struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,The beginning of their procreative power in the tents of Ham.</span>
<span id="p1304" class="sentence">52  Then he brought his people out like a flockAnd guided them like a drove in the wilderness.</span>
<span id="p1305" class="sentence">53  He led them in security,And they felt no fear;The sea covered their enemies.</span>
<span id="p1306" class="sentence">54  And he brought them to his holy territory,This mountainous region that his right hand acquired.</span>
<span id="p1307" class="sentence">55  He drove out the nations from before them;He allotted to them an inheritance by the measuring line;He settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</span>
<span id="p1308" class="sentence">56  But they kept challenging God the Most High, and rebelling against him;They did not pay attention to his reminders.</span>
<span id="p1309" class="sentence">57  They also turned away and were as treacherous as their forefathers.
They were as unreliable as a loose bow.</span>
<span id="p1310" class="sentence">58  They kept offending him with their high places,And they incited him to fury with their carved images.</span>
<span id="p1311" class="sentence">59  God heard and became furious,So he utterly rejected Israel.</span>
<span id="p1312" class="sentence">60  He finally forsook the tabernacle of Shiʹloh,The tent where he had resided among men.</span>
<span id="p1313" class="sentence">61  He let the symbol of his strength go into captivity;His splendor into the hand of the adversary.</span>
<span id="p1314" class="sentence">62  He handed his people over to the swordAnd became furious with his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1315" class="sentence">63  Fire consumed his young men,And to his virgins no wedding songs were sung.</span>
<span id="p1316" class="sentence">64  His priests fell by the sword,And their own widows did not weep.</span>
<span id="p1317" class="sentence">65  Then Jehovah woke up as from sleep,Like a mighty man waking up from wine.</span>
<span id="p1318" class="sentence">66  And he drove his adversaries back;He put them to lasting disgrace.</span>
<span id="p1319" class="sentence">67  He rejected the tent of Joseph;He did not choose the tribe of Eʹphra·im.</span>
<span id="p1320" class="sentence">68  But he chose the tribe of Judah,Mount Zion, which he loves.</span>
<span id="p1321" class="sentence">69  He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens,Like the earth that he has established forever.</span>
<span id="p1322" class="sentence">70  He chose David his servantAnd took him from the sheep pens,</span>
<span id="p1323" class="sentence">71  From tending the nursing ewes;He made him the shepherd over Jacob, his people,And over Israel, his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1324" class="sentence">72  He shepherded them with integrity of heart,And with skillful hands he led them.</span></p></level1>
