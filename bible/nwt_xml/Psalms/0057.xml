<level1><h1 id="p886">Psalm 57 To the director; set to “Do Not Bring to Ruin.” Of David. Mikʹtam. When he ran away from Saul into the cave.</h1>
<p><span id="p887" class="sentence">Show me favor, O God, show me favor,For I take refuge in you,And in the shadow of your wings I take refuge until the troubles pass.</span>
<span id="p888" class="sentence">2  I call to God the Most High,To the true God, who brings them to an end for me.</span>
<span id="p889" class="sentence">3  He will send help from heaven and save me.
He will frustrate the one snapping at me. (Selah)
God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness.</span>
<span id="p890" class="sentence">4  I am surrounded by lions;I must lie among men who want to devour me,Whose teeth are spears and arrowsAnd whose tongue is a sharp sword.</span>
<span id="p891" class="sentence">5  Be exalted above the heavens, O God;May your glory be over all the earth.</span>
<span id="p892" class="sentence">6  They have prepared a net to ensnare my feet;I am bowed down with distress.
They have dug a pit ahead of me,But they fell into it themselves. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p893" class="sentence">7  My heart is steadfast, O God,My heart is steadfast.
I will sing and make music.</span>
<span id="p894" class="sentence">8  Do awake, my glory.
Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp.
I will awaken the dawn.</span>
<span id="p895" class="sentence">9  I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah;I will sing praises to you among the nations.</span>
<span id="p896" class="sentence">10  For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens,And your faithfulness, up to the skies.</span>
<span id="p897" class="sentence">11  Be exalted above the heavens, O God;May your glory be over all the earth.</span></p></level1>
