<p><span id="p82" class="sentence">O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth;You have set your splendor even higher than the heavens!</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">2  Out of the mouth of children and infants you have established strengthOn account of your adversaries,To silence the enemy and the avenger.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">3  When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers,The moon and the stars that you have prepared,</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">4  What is mortal man that you keep him in mind,And a son of man that you take care of him?</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">5  You made him a little lower than godlike ones,And you crowned him with glory and splendor.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">6  You gave him dominion over the works of your hands;You have put everything under his feet:</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">7  All the flocks and cattle,As well as the wild animals,</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">8  The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea,Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">9  O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth!</span></p></level1>
