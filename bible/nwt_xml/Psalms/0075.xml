<p><span id="p1208" class="sentence">We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks to you;Your name is near,And people declare your wondrous works.</span>
<span id="p1209" class="sentence">2  You say: “When I set a time,I judge with fairness.</span>
<span id="p1210" class="sentence">3  When the earth and all its inhabitants were dissolved,It was I who kept its pillars firm.” (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1211" class="sentence">4  I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,”
And to the wicked, “Do not exalt your strength.</span>
<span id="p1212" class="sentence">5  Do not exalt your strength up highOr speak with arrogance.</span>
<span id="p1213" class="sentence">6  For exaltation does not comeFrom the east or the west or the south.</span>
<span id="p1214" class="sentence">7  For God is Judge.
He puts one man down and exalts another.</span>
<span id="p1215" class="sentence">8  For there is a cup in Jehovah’s hand;The wine is foaming and is fully mixed.
He will surely pour it out,And all the wicked of the earth will drink it, down to the dregs.”</span>
<span id="p1216" class="sentence">9  But as for me, I will proclaim it forever;I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</span>
<span id="p1217" class="sentence">10  For he says: “I will cut off all the strength of the wicked,But the strength of the righteous will be exalted.”</span></p></level1>
