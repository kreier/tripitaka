<level1><h1 id="p448">Psalm 32 Of David. Masʹkil.</h1>
<p><span id="p449" class="sentence">Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.</span>
<span id="p450" class="sentence">2  Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt,In whose spirit there is no deceit.</span>
<span id="p451" class="sentence">3  When I kept silent, my bones wasted away because of my groaning all day long.</span>
<span id="p452" class="sentence">4  For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
My strength evaporated like water in the dry summer heat. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p453" class="sentence">5  Finally I confessed my sin to you;I did not cover my error.
I said: “I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah.”
And you pardoned the error of my sins. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p454" class="sentence">6  This is why every loyal one will pray to youWhile you may yet be found.
Then even the floodwaters will not reach him.</span>
<span id="p455" class="sentence">7  You are a hiding place for me;You will safeguard me from distress.
You will surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p456" class="sentence">8  “I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.</span>
<span id="p457" class="sentence">9  Do not become like a horse or a mule, without understanding,Whose spiritedness must be controlled with a bridle or a halterBefore it will come near to you.”</span>
<span id="p458" class="sentence">10  Many are the pains of the wicked;But the one trusting in Jehovah is surrounded by His loyal love.</span>
<span id="p459" class="sentence">11  Rejoice in Jehovah and be joyful, you righteous ones;Shout joyfully, all you who are upright in heart.</span></p></level1>
