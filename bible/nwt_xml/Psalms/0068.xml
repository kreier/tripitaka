<level1><h1 id="p1029">Psalm 68 To the director. Of David. A melody. A song.</h1>
<p><span id="p1030" class="sentence">Let God rise up, let his enemies be scattered,And let those who hate him flee from before him.</span>
<span id="p1031" class="sentence">2  As smoke is driven away, may you drive them away;As wax melts before the fire,So let the wicked perish before God.</span>
<span id="p1032" class="sentence">3  But let the righteous rejoice;May they be overjoyed before God;May they exult with rejoicing.</span>
<span id="p1033" class="sentence">4  Sing to God; sing praises to his name.
Sing to the One riding through the desert plains.
Jah is his name! Rejoice before him!</span>
<span id="p1034" class="sentence">5  A father of the fatherless and a protector of widowsIs God in his holy dwelling.</span>
<span id="p1035" class="sentence">6  God gives those who are alone a home to dwell in;He leads prisoners out into prosperity.
But the stubborn must live in a parched land.</span>
<span id="p1036" class="sentence">7  O God, when you led your people,When you marched through the desert, (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1037" class="sentence">8  The earth quaked;Heaven poured down rain because of God;This Siʹnai quaked because of God, the God of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1038" class="sentence">9  You made it rain in abundance, O God;You reinvigorated your exhausted people.</span>
<span id="p1039" class="sentence">10  They dwelled in your tent community;In your goodness, you provided for the poor, O God.</span>
<span id="p1040" class="sentence">11  Jehovah gives the command;The women proclaiming the good news are a large army.</span>
<span id="p1041" class="sentence">12  The kings of armies flee, they flee!
She who remains at home shares in the spoil.</span>
<span id="p1042" class="sentence">13  Although you men were lying among the campfires,There will be the wings of a dove covered with silver,With pinions of fine gold.</span>
<span id="p1043" class="sentence">14  When the Almighty One scattered its kings,Snow fell in Zalʹmon.</span>
<span id="p1044" class="sentence">15  The mountain of Baʹshan is a mountain of God;The mountain of Baʹshan is a mountain of peaks.</span>
<span id="p1045" class="sentence">16  Why do you look with envy, you mountains of peaks,Toward the mountain that God has chosen as his dwelling?
Indeed, Jehovah will reside there forever.</span>
<span id="p1046" class="sentence">17  The war chariots of God are tens of thousands, thousands upon thousands.
Jehovah has come from Siʹnai into the holy place.</span>
<span id="p1047" class="sentence">18  You ascended on high;You carried away captives;You took gifts in the form of men,Yes, even stubborn ones, to reside among them, O Jah God.</span>
<span id="p1048" class="sentence">19  May Jehovah be praised, who daily carries our load,The true God of our salvation. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1049" class="sentence">20  The true God is for us a God who saves;And Jehovah the Sovereign Lord provides escape from death.</span>
<span id="p1050" class="sentence">21  Yes, God will smash the heads of his enemies,The hairy crown of the head of anyone who continues in his guilt.</span>
<span id="p1051" class="sentence">22  Jehovah has said: “I will bring them back from Baʹshan;I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,</span>
<span id="p1052" class="sentence">23  So that your foot may be awash in bloodAnd the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from the enemies.”</span>
<span id="p1053" class="sentence">24  They see your processions, O God,The processions of my God, my King, into the holy place.</span>
<span id="p1054" class="sentence">25  The singers walk in front, the musicians playing stringed instruments after them;In between are the young women playing tambourines.</span>
<span id="p1055" class="sentence">26  In congregated throngs, praise God;Praise Jehovah, you who are from the Source of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1056" class="sentence">27  There Benjamin, the youngest, is subduing them,Also the princes of Judah with their noisy crowd,The princes of Zebʹu·lun, the princes of Naphʹta·li.</span>
<span id="p1057" class="sentence">28  Your God has decreed that you will be strong.
Show your strength, O God, you who have acted in our behalf.</span>
<span id="p1058" class="sentence">29  Because of your temple at Jerusalem,Kings will bring gifts to you.</span>
<span id="p1059" class="sentence">30  Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds,The assembly of bulls and their calves,Until the peoples bow down bringing pieces of silver.
But he scatters the peoples who delight in war.</span>
<span id="p1060" class="sentence">31  Bronze articles will be brought out of Egypt;Cush will hasten to offer gifts to God.</span>
<span id="p1061" class="sentence">32  O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God,Sing praises to Jehovah, (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1062" class="sentence">33  To the one who rides the ancient heaven of heavens.
Look! He thunders with his voice, his mighty voice.</span>
<span id="p1063" class="sentence">34  Acknowledge God’s strength.
His majesty is over Israel,And his strength is in the skies.</span>
<span id="p1064" class="sentence">35  God is awe-inspiring from his grand sanctuary.
He is the God of Israel,Who gives strength and power to the people.
Praise to God.</span></p></level1>
