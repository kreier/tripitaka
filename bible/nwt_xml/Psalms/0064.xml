<level1><h1 id="p975">Psalm 64 To the director. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p976" class="sentence">Hear my voice, O God, as I plead.
Safeguard my life from the dreadfulness of the enemy.</span>
<span id="p977" class="sentence">2  Shield me from the secret plots of wicked men,From the crowd of wrongdoers.</span>
<span id="p978" class="sentence">3  They sharpen their tongue just like a sword;They aim their cruel words like arrows,</span>
<span id="p979" class="sentence">4  To shoot at the innocent from their hiding places;They shoot at him suddenly, without fear.</span>
<span id="p980" class="sentence">5  They hold fast to their evil intent;They discuss how to hide their traps.
They say: “Who will see them?”</span>
<span id="p981" class="sentence">6  They search out new ways of wrongdoing;They secretly devise their shrewd strategy;The thinking within each one’s heart is unfathomable.</span>
<span id="p982" class="sentence">7  But God will shoot at them;Suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow.</span>
<span id="p983" class="sentence">8  Their own tongue will cause their downfall;All those looking on will shake their head.</span>
<span id="p984" class="sentence">9  Then all men will become afraid,And they will proclaim what God has done,And they will have insight into his deeds.</span>
<span id="p985" class="sentence">10  The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in him;All the upright in heart will exult.</span></p></level1>
