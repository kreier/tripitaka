<level1><h1 id="p91">Psalm 9 To the director; upon Muth-labʹben. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p92" class="sentence">I will praise you, O Jehovah, with all my heart;I will tell about all your wonderful works.</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">2  I will rejoice and exult in you;I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">3  When my enemies retreat,They will stumble and perish from before you.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">4  For you defend my just cause;You sit on your throne judging with righteousness.</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">5  You have rebuked nations and destroyed the wicked,Blotting out their name forever and ever.</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">6  The enemy has been ruined forever;You uprooted their cities,And all memory of them will perish.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">7  But Jehovah is enthroned forever;He has firmly established his throne for justice.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">8  He will judge the inhabited earth in righteousness;He will render righteous legal decisions for the nations.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">9  Jehovah will become a secure refuge for the oppressed,A secure refuge in times of distress.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">10  Those knowing your name will trust in you;You will never abandon those seeking you, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">11  Sing praises to Jehovah, who is dwelling in Zion;Make his deeds known among the peoples.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">12  For the One who avenges their blood remembers them;He will not forget the cry of the afflicted.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">13  Show me favor, O Jehovah; see my affliction by those hating me,You who raise me from the gates of death,</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">14  So that I may declare your praiseworthy deeds in the gates of the daughter of Zion,And rejoice in your acts of salvation.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">15  The nations have sunk down into the pit they made;Their own foot has been caught in the net they hid.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">16  Jehovah is known by the judgment he executes.
The wicked one has been ensnared in the work of his own hands.
Hig·gaʹion. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">17  The wicked will retreat toward the Grave,All the nations who forget God.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">18  But the poor will not always be forgotten;Nor will the hope of the meek ever perish.</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">19  Rise up, O Jehovah! Do not let mortal man prevail.
May the nations be judged in your presence.</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">20  Strike them with fear, O Jehovah,Let the nations know that they are only mortal men. (Selah)</span></p></level1>
