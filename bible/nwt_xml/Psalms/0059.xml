<level1><h1 id="p910">Psalm 59 To the director; set to “Do Not Bring to Ruin.” Of David. Mikʹtam. When Saul sent men to watch David’s house to put him to death.</h1>
<p><span id="p911" class="sentence">Rescue me from my enemies, O my God;Protect me from those rising up against me.</span>
<span id="p912" class="sentence">2  Rescue me from those who act wickedly,And save me from violent men.</span>
<span id="p913" class="sentence">3  Look! They wait to ambush me;Strong men attack meBut not because I have revolted or sinned, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p914" class="sentence">4  Though I did no wrong, they run and prepare to attack.
Do arise at my calling and see.</span>
<span id="p915" class="sentence">5  For you, O Jehovah God of armies, are the God of Israel.
Awake to turn your attention to all the nations.
Do not show mercy to any malicious traitors. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p916" class="sentence">6  They return each evening;They growl like dogs and prowl around the city.</span>
<span id="p917" class="sentence">7  Look what pours forth from their mouth;Their lips are like swords,For they say: “Who is listening?”</span>
<span id="p918" class="sentence">8  But you, O Jehovah, will laugh at them;You will scoff at all the nations.</span>
<span id="p919" class="sentence">9  O my Strength, I will keep watch for you;For God is my secure refuge.</span>
<span id="p920" class="sentence">10  The God who shows loyal love to me will come to my aid;God will cause me to look in triumph on my foes.</span>
<span id="p921" class="sentence">11  Do not kill them, so that my people may not forget.
By your power make them wander about;Cause their downfall, O Jehovah, our shield.</span>
<span id="p922" class="sentence">12  For the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips,May they be trapped by their pride,Because of the cursing and deception that they speak.</span>
<span id="p923" class="sentence">13  Finish them off in your wrath;Finish them off, so that they are no more;Make them know that God is ruling in Jacob and to the ends of the earth. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p924" class="sentence">14  Let them return in the evening;Let them growl like dogs and prowl around the city.</span>
<span id="p925" class="sentence">15  Let them wander about for something to eat;Do not let them be satisfied or find a lodging place.</span>
<span id="p926" class="sentence">16  But as for me, I will sing about your strength;In the morning I will joyfully tell about your loyal love.
For you are my secure refugeAnd a place for me to flee in my time of distress.</span>
<span id="p927" class="sentence">17  O my Strength, to you I will sing praises,For God is my secure refuge, the God who shows loyal love to me.</span></p></level1>
