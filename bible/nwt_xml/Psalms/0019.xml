<level1><h1 id="p248">Psalm 19 To the director. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p249" class="sentence">The heavens are declaring the glory of God;The skies above proclaim the work of his hands.</span>
<span id="p250" class="sentence">2  Day after day their speech bubbles forth,And night after night they reveal knowledge.</span>
<span id="p251" class="sentence">3  There is no speech, and there are no words;Their voice is not heard.</span>
<span id="p252" class="sentence">4  But into all the earth their sound has gone out,And to the ends of the inhabited earth their message.
In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun;</span>
<span id="p253" class="sentence">5  It is like a bridegroom emerging from the bridal chamber;It rejoices like a mighty man running his course.</span>
<span id="p254" class="sentence">6  It emerges from one end of the heavens,And it circles to their other end;And nothing is concealed from its heat.</span>
<span id="p255" class="sentence">7  The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength.
The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.</span>
<span id="p256" class="sentence">8  The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice;The commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.</span>
<span id="p257" class="sentence">9  The fear of Jehovah is pure, lasting forever.
The judgments of Jehovah are true, altogether righteous.</span>
<span id="p258" class="sentence">10  They are more desirable than gold,Than much fine gold,And sweeter than honey, the honey that drips from the combs.</span>
<span id="p259" class="sentence">11  By them your servant has been warned;In keeping them, there is a large reward.</span>
<span id="p260" class="sentence">12  Who can discern mistakes?
Pronounce me innocent from sins I am unaware of.</span>
<span id="p261" class="sentence">13  And hold your servant back from presumptuous acts;Do not let them dominate me.
Then I will be complete,And innocent of blatant sins.</span>
<span id="p262" class="sentence">14  May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heartBe pleasing to you, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.</span></p></level1>
