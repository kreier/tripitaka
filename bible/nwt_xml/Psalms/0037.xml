<level1><h1 id="p548">Psalm 37 Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p549" class="sentence">Do not be upset because of evil menOr envious of wrongdoers.</span>
<span id="p550" class="sentence">2  They will quickly wither like grassAnd shrivel like green new grass.</span>
<span id="p551" class="sentence">3  Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;Reside in the earth, and act with faithfulness.</span>
<span id="p552" class="sentence">4  Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,And he will grant you the desires of your heart.</span>
<span id="p553" class="sentence">5  Commit your way to Jehovah;Rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.</span>
<span id="p554" class="sentence">6  He will make your righteousness shine like daybreak,And your justice like the midday sun.</span>
<span id="p555" class="sentence">7  Keep silent before JehovahAnd wait expectantly for him.
Do not be upset by the manWho succeeds in carrying out his schemes.</span>
<span id="p556" class="sentence">8  Let go of anger and abandon rage;Do not become upset and turn to doing evil.</span>
<span id="p557" class="sentence">9  For evil men will be done away with,But those hoping in Jehovah will possess the earth.</span>
<span id="p558" class="sentence">10  Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more;You will look at where they were,And they will not be there.</span>
<span id="p559" class="sentence">11  But the meek will possess the earth,And they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.</span>
<span id="p560" class="sentence">12  The wicked man plots against the righteous;He grinds his teeth at him.</span>
<span id="p561" class="sentence">13  But Jehovah will laugh at him,For He knows that his day will come.</span>
<span id="p562" class="sentence">14  The wicked draw their swords and bend their bowsTo bring down the oppressed and the poor,To slaughter those whose way is upright.</span>
<span id="p563" class="sentence">15  But their sword will pierce their own heart;Their bows will be broken.</span>
<span id="p564" class="sentence">16  Better is the little of the righteous oneThan the abundance of many wicked ones.</span>
<span id="p565" class="sentence">17  For the arms of the wicked will be broken,But Jehovah will support the righteous.</span>
<span id="p566" class="sentence">18  Jehovah is aware of what the blameless go through,And their inheritance will last forever.</span>
<span id="p567" class="sentence">19  They will not be put to shame in the time of disaster;In the time of famine they will have plenty.</span>
<span id="p568" class="sentence">20  But the wicked will perish;The enemies of Jehovah will vanish like glorious pastures;They will vanish like smoke.</span>
<span id="p569" class="sentence">21  The wicked one borrows and does not repay,But the righteous one is generous and giving.</span>
<span id="p570" class="sentence">22  Those blessed by Him will possess the earth,But those cursed by Him will be done away with.</span>
<span id="p571" class="sentence">23  Jehovah guides the steps of a manWhen He finds pleasure in his way.</span>
<span id="p572" class="sentence">24  Although he may fall, he will not be hurled down,For Jehovah supports him by the hand.</span>
<span id="p573" class="sentence">25  I was once young and now I am old,But I have not seen anyone righteous abandoned,Nor his children looking for bread.</span>
<span id="p574" class="sentence">26  He always lends freely,And his children are in line for a blessing.</span>
<span id="p575" class="sentence">27  Turn away from bad and do what is good,And you will remain forever.</span>
<span id="p576" class="sentence">28  For Jehovah loves justice,And he will not abandon his loyal ones.
ע [Ayin]
They will always be guarded;But the descendants of the wicked will be done away with.</span>
<span id="p577" class="sentence">29  The righteous will possess the earth,And they will live forever on it.</span>
<span id="p578" class="sentence">30  The mouth of the righteous one imparts wisdom,And his tongue speaks about justice.</span>
<span id="p579" class="sentence">31  The law of his God is in his heart;His steps will not falter.</span>
<span id="p580" class="sentence">32  The wicked watches the righteous,Seeking to put him to death.</span>
<span id="p581" class="sentence">33  But Jehovah will not abandon him to the hand of that oneOr find him guilty when he is judged.</span>
<span id="p582" class="sentence">34  Hope in Jehovah and follow his way,And he will exalt you to take possession of the earth.
When the wicked are done away with, you will see it.</span>
<span id="p583" class="sentence">35  I have seen the ruthless, evil manSpreading out like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.</span>
<span id="p584" class="sentence">36  But he suddenly passed away and was gone;I kept searching for him, and he could not be found.</span>
<span id="p585" class="sentence">37  Take note of the blameless one,And keep the upright one in sight,For the future of that man will be peaceful.</span>
<span id="p586" class="sentence">38  But all the transgressors will be destroyed;The future of wicked people will be cut off.</span>
<span id="p587" class="sentence">39  The salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah;He is their fortress in the time of distress.</span>
<span id="p588" class="sentence">40  Jehovah will help them and rescue them.
He will rescue them from the wicked and save them,Because they take refuge in him.</span></p></level1>
