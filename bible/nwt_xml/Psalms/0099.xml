<p><span id="p1660" class="sentence">Jehovah has become King. Let the peoples tremble.
He sits enthroned above the cherubs. Let the earth shake.</span>
<span id="p1661" class="sentence">2  Jehovah is great in Zion,And he is high over all the peoples.</span>
<span id="p1662" class="sentence">3  Let them praise your great name,For it is awe-inspiring and holy.</span>
<span id="p1663" class="sentence">4  He is a mighty king who loves justice.
You have firmly established what is upright.
You have brought about justice and righteousness in Jacob.</span>
<span id="p1664" class="sentence">5  Exalt Jehovah our God and bow down at his footstool;He is holy.</span>
<span id="p1665" class="sentence">6  Moses and Aaron were among his priests,And Samuel was among those calling on his name.
They would call to Jehovah,And he would answer them.</span>
<span id="p1666" class="sentence">7  He would speak to them from the pillar of cloud.
They kept his reminders and the decree that he gave to them.</span>
<span id="p1667" class="sentence">8  O Jehovah our God, you answered them.
You were a God who pardoned them,But you punished them for their sinful deeds.</span>
<span id="p1668" class="sentence">9  Exalt Jehovah our GodAnd bow down before his holy mountain,For Jehovah our God is holy.</span></p></level1>
