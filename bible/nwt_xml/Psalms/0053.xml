<level1><h1 id="p833">Psalm 53 To the director; in the style of Maʹha·lath. Masʹkil. Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p834" class="sentence">The foolish one says in his heart:
“There is no Jehovah.”
Their unrighteous actions are corrupt and detestable;No one is doing good.</span>
<span id="p835" class="sentence">2  But God looks down from heaven on the sons of menTo see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p836" class="sentence">3  They have all turned away;They are all alike corrupt.
No one is doing good,Not even one.</span>
<span id="p837" class="sentence">4  Do none of the wrongdoers understand?
They devour my people as if they were eating bread.
They do not call on Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p838" class="sentence">5  But they will be filled with great terror,Terror they have never felt before,For God will scatter the bones of those attacking you.
You will put them to shame, for Jehovah has rejected them.</span>
<span id="p839" class="sentence">6  O that Israel’s salvation may come from Zion!
When Jehovah gathers back his captive people,Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.</span></p></level1>
