<level1><h1 id="p197">Psalm 18 To the director. By Jehovah’s servant David, who addressed the words of this song to Jehovah in the day that Jehovah rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:</h1>
<p><span id="p198" class="sentence">I have affection for you, O Jehovah, my strength.</span>
<span id="p199" class="sentence">2  Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the One who rescues me.
My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,My shield and my horn of salvation, my secure refuge.</span>
<span id="p200" class="sentence">3  I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,And I will be saved from my enemies.</span>
<span id="p201" class="sentence">4  The ropes of death encircled me;Flash floods of worthless men terrified me.</span>
<span id="p202" class="sentence">5  The ropes of the Grave surrounded me;The snares of death confronted me.</span>
<span id="p203" class="sentence">6  In my distress I called on Jehovah,To my God I kept crying for help.
From his temple he heard my voice,And my cry to him for help reached his ears.</span>
<span id="p204" class="sentence">7  Then the earth began to shake and rock;The foundations of the mountains trembledAnd shook back and forth because he had been angered.</span>
<span id="p205" class="sentence">8  Smoke ascended from his nostrils,And a consuming fire came from his mouth;Glowing coals blazed from him.</span>
<span id="p206" class="sentence">9  He made the heavens bend as he descended,And thick gloom was beneath his feet.</span>
<span id="p207" class="sentence">10  He rode on a cherub and came flying.
He swooped down on the wings of a spirit.</span>
<span id="p208" class="sentence">11  He then covered himself in darkness,All around him as a shelter,Dark waters and thick clouds.</span>
<span id="p209" class="sentence">12  From the brightness before himHail and fiery coals broke through the clouds.</span>
<span id="p210" class="sentence">13  Then Jehovah began to thunder in the heavens;The Most High made his voice heardWith hailstones and fiery coals.</span>
<span id="p211" class="sentence">14  He shot his arrows and scattered them;He hurled his lightning and threw them into confusion.</span>
<span id="p212" class="sentence">15  The streambeds became visible;The foundations of the land were exposed by your rebuke, O Jehovah,By the blast of the breath from your nostrils.</span>
<span id="p213" class="sentence">16  He reached down from on high;He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.</span>
<span id="p214" class="sentence">17  He rescued me from my strong enemy,From those hating me, who were stronger than I was.</span>
<span id="p215" class="sentence">18  They confronted me on the day of my disaster,But Jehovah was my support.</span>
<span id="p216" class="sentence">19  He brought me out into a place of safety;He rescued me because he was pleased with me.</span>
<span id="p217" class="sentence">20  Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;He repays me according to the innocence of my hands.</span>
<span id="p218" class="sentence">21  For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,And I have not wickedly abandoned my God.</span>
<span id="p219" class="sentence">22  All his judgments are before me;I will not disregard his statutes.</span>
<span id="p220" class="sentence">23  I will remain blameless before him,And I will keep myself from error.</span>
<span id="p221" class="sentence">24  May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,According to the innocence of my hands before him.</span>
<span id="p222" class="sentence">25  With someone loyal you act in loyalty;With the blameless man you deal blamelessly;</span>
<span id="p223" class="sentence">26  With the pure you show yourself pure,But with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</span>
<span id="p224" class="sentence">27  For you save those who are lowlyBut you abase the haughty.</span>
<span id="p225" class="sentence">28  For it is you who light my lamp, O Jehovah,My God who lights up my darkness.</span>
<span id="p226" class="sentence">29  With your help I can charge against a marauder band;By God’s power I can scale a wall.</span>
<span id="p227" class="sentence">30  The way of the true God is perfect;The saying of Jehovah is refined.
He is a shield to all those taking refuge in him.</span>
<span id="p228" class="sentence">31  For who is a God besides Jehovah?
And who is a rock except our God?</span>
<span id="p229" class="sentence">32  The true God is the one who clothes me with strength,And he will make my way perfect.</span>
<span id="p230" class="sentence">33  He makes my feet like those of a deer;He makes me stand on high places.</span>
<span id="p231" class="sentence">34  He trains my hands for warfare;My arms can bend a bow of copper.</span>
<span id="p232" class="sentence">35  You give me your shield of salvation,Your right hand supports me,And your humility makes me great.</span>
<span id="p233" class="sentence">36  You widen the path for my footsteps;My feet will not slip.</span>
<span id="p234" class="sentence">37  I will pursue my enemies and overtake them;I will not return until they are wiped out.</span>
<span id="p235" class="sentence">38  I will crush them so that they cannot rise up;They will fall under my feet.</span>
<span id="p236" class="sentence">39  You will equip me with strength for the battle;You will make my foes collapse under me.</span>
<span id="p237" class="sentence">40  You will make my enemies retreat from me,And I will put an end to those who hate me.</span>
<span id="p238" class="sentence">41  They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;They even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them.</span>
<span id="p239" class="sentence">42  I will pound them as fine as dust in the wind;I will throw them out like mud in the streets.</span>
<span id="p240" class="sentence">43  You will rescue me from the faultfinding of the people.
You will appoint me the head of nations.
A people whom I have not known will serve me.</span>
<span id="p241" class="sentence">44  At a mere report they will obey me;Foreigners will come cringing before me.</span>
<span id="p242" class="sentence">45  Foreigners will lose courage;They will come trembling from their strongholds.</span>
<span id="p243" class="sentence">46  Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!
Let the God of my salvation be exalted.</span>
<span id="p244" class="sentence">47  The true God executes vengeance for me;He subdues the peoples under me.</span>
<span id="p245" class="sentence">48  He rescues me from my angry enemies;You lift me high above those who attack me;You save me from the man of violence.</span>
<span id="p246" class="sentence">49  That is why I will glorify you among the nations, O Jehovah,And to your name I will sing praises.</span>
<span id="p247" class="sentence">50  He performs great acts of salvation for his king;He displays loyal love to his anointed one,To David and his offspring forever.</span></p></level1>
