<level1><h1 id="p287">Psalm 22 To the director; set to “The Doe of the Dawn.” A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p288" class="sentence">My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
Why are you far from saving me,Far from my cries of anguish?</span>
<span id="p289" class="sentence">2  My God, I keep calling by day, and you do not answer;And by night there is no silence on my part.</span>
<span id="p290" class="sentence">3  But you are holy,Surrounded by the praises of Israel.</span>
<span id="p291" class="sentence">4  In you our fathers put their trust;They trusted, and you kept rescuing them.</span>
<span id="p292" class="sentence">5  To you they cried out, and they were saved;They trusted in you, and they were not disappointed.</span>
<span id="p293" class="sentence">6  But I am a worm and not a man,Scorned by men and despised by the people.</span>
<span id="p294" class="sentence">7  All those seeing me mock me;They sneer and shake their heads in derision:</span>
<span id="p295" class="sentence">8  “He entrusted himself to Jehovah. Let Him rescue him!
Let Him save him, for he is so dear to Him!”</span>
<span id="p296" class="sentence">9  You were the One who brought me out of the womb,The One who made me feel secure on my mother’s breasts.</span>
<span id="p297" class="sentence">10  I have been entrusted to your care from birth;From my mother’s womb, you have been my God.</span>
<span id="p298" class="sentence">11  Do not stay far off from me, for trouble is nearAnd I have no other helper.</span>
<span id="p299" class="sentence">12  Many young bulls surround me;Powerful bulls of Baʹshan encircle me.</span>
<span id="p300" class="sentence">13  They open their mouth wide against me,Like a roaring lion that tears its prey to pieces.</span>
<span id="p301" class="sentence">14  I am poured out like water;All my bones are out of joint.
My heart has become like wax;It melts deep within me.</span>
<span id="p302" class="sentence">15  My strength has dried up like a piece of pottery;My tongue sticks to my gums;You are bringing me down to the dust of death.</span>
<span id="p303" class="sentence">16  For dogs surround me;They close in on me like a pack of evildoers,Like a lion they are at my hands and feet.</span>
<span id="p304" class="sentence">17  I can count all my bones.
They look on and stare at me.</span>
<span id="p305" class="sentence">18  They divide my garments among themselves,And they cast lots for my clothing.</span>
<span id="p306" class="sentence">19  But you, O Jehovah, do not remain far away.
You are my strength; hurry to help me.</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">20  Save me from the sword,My precious life from the paws of dogs;</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">21  Save me from the mouth of the lion and the horns of wild bulls;Answer and save me.</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">22  I will declare your name to my brothers;In the midst of the congregation I will praise you.</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">23  You who fear Jehovah, praise him!
All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him!
Stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel.</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">24  For he has not despised nor loathed the suffering of the oppressed one;He has not hidden his face from him.
When he cried to him for help, he heard.</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">25  I will praise you in the large congregation;I will pay my vows before those who fear him.</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">26  The meek will eat and be satisfied;Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.
May you enjoy life forever.</span>
<span id="p314" class="sentence">27  All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to Jehovah.
All the families of the nations will bow down before you.</span>
<span id="p315" class="sentence">28  For the kingship belongs to Jehovah;He rules over the nations.</span>
<span id="p316" class="sentence">29  All the prosperous ones of the earth will eat and will bow down;All those going down to the dust will kneel before him;None of them can preserve their lives.</span>
<span id="p317" class="sentence">30  Their descendants will serve him;The generation to come will be told about Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p318" class="sentence">31  They will come and tell of his righteousness.
They will tell the people yet to be born what he has done.</span></p></level1>
