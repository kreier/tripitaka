<p><span id="p274" class="sentence">O Jehovah, in your strength the king rejoices;How greatly he rejoices in your acts of salvation!</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">2  You have granted him the desire of his heart,And you have not withheld the request of his lips. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">3  For you meet him with rich blessings;You place a crown of fine gold on his head.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">4  He asked you for life, and you gave it to him,A long life, forever and ever.</span>
<span id="p278" class="sentence">5  Your acts of salvation bring him great glory.
Dignity and splendor you bestow on him.</span>
<span id="p279" class="sentence">6  You make him blessed forever;You make him glad with the joy of your presence.</span>
<span id="p280" class="sentence">7  For the king trusts in Jehovah;Because of the loyal love of the Most High, he will never be shaken.</span>
<span id="p281" class="sentence">8  Your hand will find all your enemies;Your right hand will find those hating you.</span>
<span id="p282" class="sentence">9  You will make them like a fiery furnace at the appointed time when you give them attention.
Jehovah will swallow them up in his anger, and fire will consume them.</span>
<span id="p283" class="sentence">10  Their descendants you will destroy from the earth,And their offspring from the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p284" class="sentence">11  For they intended to do what is bad against you;They have devised schemes that will not succeed.</span>
<span id="p285" class="sentence">12  For you will make them retreatBy aiming your bow at them.</span>
<span id="p286" class="sentence">13  Rise up, O Jehovah, in your strength.
We will sing praises to your mightiness.</span></p></level1>
