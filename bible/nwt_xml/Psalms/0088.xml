<level1><h1 id="p1457">Psalm 88 A song. A melody of the sons of Korʹah. To the director; in the style of Maʹha·lath, to be sung alternately. Masʹkil of Heʹman the Ezʹra·hite.</h1>
<p><span id="p1458" class="sentence">O Jehovah, the God of my salvation,By day I cry out,And by night I come before you.</span>
<span id="p1459" class="sentence">2  Let my prayer come to you,Incline your ear to my cry for help.</span>
<span id="p1460" class="sentence">3  For my soul has been filled with calamity,And my life is on the brink of the Grave.</span>
<span id="p1461" class="sentence">4  I am already counted among those going down to the pit;I have become a helpless man,</span>
<span id="p1462" class="sentence">5  Left among the deadLike the slain lying in a grave,Whom you remember no longerAnd who have been separated from your care.</span>
<span id="p1463" class="sentence">6  You have put me in the lowest pit,In dark places, in a large abyss.</span>
<span id="p1464" class="sentence">7  Your rage weighs heavily on me,And you overwhelm me with your crashing waves. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1465" class="sentence">8  You have driven my acquaintances far away from me;You have made me something detestable to them.
I am trapped and cannot escape.</span>
<span id="p1466" class="sentence">9  My eye is worn out because of my affliction.
I call on you, O Jehovah, all day long;To you I spread out my hands.</span>
<span id="p1467" class="sentence">10  Will you perform wonders for the dead?
Can those powerless in death rise up to praise you? (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1468" class="sentence">11  Will your loyal love be declared in the grave,Your faithfulness in the place of destruction?</span>
<span id="p1469" class="sentence">12  Will your wonders be known in the darknessOr your righteousness in the land of oblivion?</span>
<span id="p1470" class="sentence">13  But I still cry to you for help, O Jehovah,Each morning my prayer comes before you.</span>
<span id="p1471" class="sentence">14  Why, O Jehovah, do you reject me?
Why do you hide your face from me?</span>
<span id="p1472" class="sentence">15  From my youth on,I have been afflicted and ready to perish;I am numb from the terrible things you allow me to suffer.</span>
<span id="p1473" class="sentence">16  Your burning anger overwhelms me;Your terrors destroy me.</span>
<span id="p1474" class="sentence">17  They surround me like waters all day long;They close in on me from all sides.</span>
<span id="p1475" class="sentence">18  You have driven my friends and companions far away from me;Darkness has become my companion.</span></p></level1>
