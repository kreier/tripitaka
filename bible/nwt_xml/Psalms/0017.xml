<level1><h1 id="p181">Psalm 17 A prayer of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p182" class="sentence">Hear my plea for justice, O Jehovah;Pay attention to my cry for help;Listen to my prayer spoken without deceit.</span>
<span id="p183" class="sentence">2  May you make a just decision in my behalf;May your eyes see what is right.</span>
<span id="p184" class="sentence">3  You have examined my heart, you have inspected me by night;You have refined me;You will find that I have not schemed anything bad,And my mouth has not transgressed.</span>
<span id="p185" class="sentence">4  As for the activities of men,In accord with the word of your lips, I avoid the paths of the robber.</span>
<span id="p186" class="sentence">5  Let my steps stay on your tracksSo that my feet will not stumble.</span>
<span id="p187" class="sentence">6  I do call on you, because you will answer me, O God.
Incline your ear to me. Hear my words.</span>
<span id="p188" class="sentence">7  Show your loyal love in a wonderful way,O Savior of those seeking refuge at your right handFrom those who rebel against you.</span>
<span id="p189" class="sentence">8  Guard me like the pupil of your eye;Conceal me in the shadow of your wings.</span>
<span id="p190" class="sentence">9  Guard me from the wicked who attack me,From my mortal enemies who surround me.</span>
<span id="p191" class="sentence">10  They have become insensitive;With their mouth they speak arrogantly;</span>
<span id="p192" class="sentence">11  Now they hem us in;They watch for the chance to cause our downfall.</span>
<span id="p193" class="sentence">12  He is like a lion eager to tear its prey to pieces,Like a young lion crouching in ambush.</span>
<span id="p194" class="sentence">13  Rise up, O Jehovah, to confront him and bring him down;Rescue me from the wicked with your sword;</span>
<span id="p195" class="sentence">14  Rescue me with your hand, O Jehovah,From men of this world, whose share is in this life,Those whom you fill with the good things you provideAnd who leave an inheritance to their many sons.</span>
<span id="p196" class="sentence">15  But as for me, in righteousness I will see your face;I am satisfied to awaken in your presence.</span></p></level1>
