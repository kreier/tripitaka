<level1><h1 id="p1586">Psalm 94</h1>
<p><span id="p1587" class="sentence">O God of vengeance, Jehovah,O God of vengeance, shine forth!</span>
<span id="p1588" class="sentence">2  Rise up, O Judge of the earth.
Repay to the haughty what they deserve.</span>
<span id="p1589" class="sentence">3  How long will the wicked, O Jehovah,How long will the wicked continue to exult?</span>
<span id="p1590" class="sentence">4  They babble and speak arrogantly;All the wrongdoers brag about themselves.</span>
<span id="p1591" class="sentence">5  They crush your people, O Jehovah,And oppress your inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1592" class="sentence">6  They kill the widow and the foreign resident,And they murder the fatherless children.</span>
<span id="p1593" class="sentence">7  They say: “Jah does not see;The God of Jacob does not take notice of it.”</span>
<span id="p1594" class="sentence">8  Understand this, you who are unreasoning;You foolish ones, when will you ever show insight?</span>
<span id="p1595" class="sentence">9  The One who made the ear, can he not hear?
The One who formed the eye, can he not see?</span>
<span id="p1596" class="sentence">10  The One correcting the nations, can he not reprove?
He is the One who imparts knowledge to people!</span>
<span id="p1597" class="sentence">11  Jehovah knows the thoughts of men,That they are but a mere breath.</span>
<span id="p1598" class="sentence">12  Happy is the man whom you correct, O Jah,Whom you teach from your law,</span>
<span id="p1599" class="sentence">13  To give him tranquility during days of calamity,Until a pit is dug for the wicked.</span>
<span id="p1600" class="sentence">14  For Jehovah will not forsake his people,Nor will he abandon his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1601" class="sentence">15  For judgment will once again be righteous,And all the upright in heart will follow it.</span>
<span id="p1602" class="sentence">16  Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
Who will take a stand for me against the wrongdoers?</span>
<span id="p1603" class="sentence">17  If Jehovah had not been my helper,I would soon have perished.</span>
<span id="p1604" class="sentence">18  When I said: “My foot is slipping,”
Your loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me.</span>
<span id="p1605" class="sentence">19  When anxieties overwhelmed me,You comforted and soothed me.</span>
<span id="p1606" class="sentence">20  Can a throne of corruption be allied with youWhile it is framing trouble in the name of the law?</span>
<span id="p1607" class="sentence">21  They make vicious attacks on the righteous oneAnd condemn the innocent one to death.</span>
<span id="p1608" class="sentence">22  But Jehovah will become a secure refuge for me,My God is my rock of refuge.</span>
<span id="p1609" class="sentence">23  He will make their wicked deeds come back upon them.
He will do away with them by means of their own evil.
Jehovah our God will do away with them.</span></p></level1>
