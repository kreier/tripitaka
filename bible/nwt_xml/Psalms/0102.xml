<level1><h1 id="p1684">Psalm 102 A prayer of the oppressed one when he is in despair and pours out his concern before Jehovah.</h1>
<p><span id="p1685" class="sentence">O Jehovah, hear my prayer;Let my cry for help reach you.</span>
<span id="p1686" class="sentence">2  Do not hide your face from me in my time of distress.
Incline your ear to me;Do answer me quickly when I call.</span>
<span id="p1687" class="sentence">3  For my days are vanishing like smoke,And my bones are charred like a fireplace.</span>
<span id="p1688" class="sentence">4  My heart has been struck down like grass and has withered,For I forget to eat my food.</span>
<span id="p1689" class="sentence">5  Because of my loud groaning,My bones cling to my flesh.</span>
<span id="p1690" class="sentence">6  I resemble the pelican of the wilderness;I am like a little owl among the ruins.</span>
<span id="p1691" class="sentence">7  I lie awake;I am like a solitary bird on a roof.</span>
<span id="p1692" class="sentence">8  All day long my enemies taunt me.
Those who mock me use my name as a curse.</span>
<span id="p1693" class="sentence">9  For I eat ashes as my bread,And my drink is mingled with tears,</span>
<span id="p1694" class="sentence">10  Because of your anger and your indignation,For you lifted me up only to cast me aside.</span>
<span id="p1695" class="sentence">11  My days are like a fading shadow,And I am withering like grass.</span>
<span id="p1696" class="sentence">12  But you remain forever, O Jehovah,And your fame will endure for all generations.</span>
<span id="p1697" class="sentence">13  Surely you will rise up and show mercy on Zion,For it is time to show her your favor;The appointed time has come.</span>
<span id="p1698" class="sentence">14  For your servants find pleasure in her stonesAnd have affection even for her dust.</span>
<span id="p1699" class="sentence">15  The nations will fear the name of Jehovah,And all the kings of the earth your glory.</span>
<span id="p1700" class="sentence">16  For Jehovah will rebuild Zion;He will appear in his glory.</span>
<span id="p1701" class="sentence">17  He will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute;He will not despise their prayer.</span>
<span id="p1702" class="sentence">18  This is written for the future generation,So that a people yet to be brought forth will praise Jah.</span>
<span id="p1703" class="sentence">19  For he looks down from his holy height,From the heavens Jehovah views the earth,</span>
<span id="p1704" class="sentence">20  To hear the sighing of the prisoner,To release those sentenced to death,</span>
<span id="p1705" class="sentence">21  So that the name of Jehovah will be declared in ZionAnd his praise in Jerusalem,</span>
<span id="p1706" class="sentence">22  When the peoples and kingdomsGather together to serve Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1707" class="sentence">23  He prematurely robbed me of my strength;He cut short my days.</span>
<span id="p1708" class="sentence">24  I said: “O my God,Do not do away with me in the middle of my life,You whose years span all generations.</span>
<span id="p1709" class="sentence">25  Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth,And the heavens are the work of your hands.</span>
<span id="p1710" class="sentence">26  They will perish, but you will remain;Just like a garment they will all wear out.
Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will pass away.</span>
<span id="p1711" class="sentence">27  But you are the same, and your years will never end.</span>
<span id="p1712" class="sentence">28  The children of your servants will dwell securely,And their offspring will be firmly established before you.”</span></p></level1>
