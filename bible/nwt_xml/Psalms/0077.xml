<level1><h1 id="p1231">Psalm 77 To the director; on Je·duʹthun. Of Aʹsaph. A melody.</h1>
<p><span id="p1232" class="sentence">With my voice I will cry out to God;To God I will cry out, and he will hear me.</span>
<span id="p1233" class="sentence">2  In the day of my distress I search for Jehovah.
At night my hands are stretched out to him without ceasing.
I cannot be comforted.</span>
<span id="p1234" class="sentence">3  When I remember God, I groan;I am troubled and my strength fails. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1235" class="sentence">4  You hold my eyelids open;I am agitated and cannot speak.</span>
<span id="p1236" class="sentence">5  My thoughts turn to the days of long ago,The years of the distant past.</span>
<span id="p1237" class="sentence">6  During the night I remember my song;I ponder in my heart;I make a diligent search.</span>
<span id="p1238" class="sentence">7  Will Jehovah cast us off forever?
Will he never again show his favor?</span>
<span id="p1239" class="sentence">8  Has his loyal love ceased forever?
Will his promise come to nothing for all generations?</span>
<span id="p1240" class="sentence">9  Has God forgotten to show his favor,Or has his anger caused his mercy to cease? (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1241" class="sentence">10  Must I keep saying: “This is what distresses me:
The Most High has changed his position toward us”?</span>
<span id="p1242" class="sentence">11  I will remember the works of Jah;I will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago.</span>
<span id="p1243" class="sentence">12  And I will meditate on all your activityAnd ponder over your dealings.</span>
<span id="p1244" class="sentence">13  O God, your ways are holy.
What god is as great as you, O God?</span>
<span id="p1245" class="sentence">14  You are the true God, who does marvelous things.
You have revealed your strength to the peoples.</span>
<span id="p1246" class="sentence">15  With your power you have rescued your people,The sons of Jacob and of Joseph. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1247" class="sentence">16  The waters saw you, O God;The waters saw you and were disturbed.
And the deep waters became agitated.</span>
<span id="p1248" class="sentence">17  The clouds poured down water.
The cloudy skies thundered,And your arrows flew here and there.</span>
<span id="p1249" class="sentence">18  The sound of your thunder was like chariot wheels;Flashes of lightning lit up the inhabited earth;The earth trembled and quaked.</span>
<span id="p1250" class="sentence">19  Your way was through the sea,Your path through many waters;But your footprints could not be traced.</span>
<span id="p1251" class="sentence">20  You led your people just like a flock,In the care of Moses and Aaron.</span></p></level1>
