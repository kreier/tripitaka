<level1><h1 id="p963">Psalm 63 A melody of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.</h1>
<p><span id="p964" class="sentence">O God, you are my God, I keep looking for you.
I do thirst for you.
I am faint with longing for youIn a dry and parched land, where there is no water.</span>
<span id="p965" class="sentence">2  So I have looked upon you in the holy place;I have seen your strength and your glory.</span>
<span id="p966" class="sentence">3  Because your loyal love is better than life,My own lips will glorify you.</span>
<span id="p967" class="sentence">4  Thus I will praise you all my life;In your name I will lift up my hands.</span>
<span id="p968" class="sentence">5  I am satisfied with the best and choicest portion,So my mouth will praise you with joy on my lips.</span>
<span id="p969" class="sentence">6  I remember you while upon my bed;I meditate on you during the watches of the night.</span>
<span id="p970" class="sentence">7  For you are my helper,And I shout joyfully in the shadow of your wings.</span>
<span id="p971" class="sentence">8  I cling to you;Your right hand keeps fast hold on me.</span>
<span id="p972" class="sentence">9  But those who seek to destroy my lifeWill descend into the depths of the earth.</span>
<span id="p973" class="sentence">10  They will be handed over to the power of the sword;They will become food for jackals.</span>
<span id="p974" class="sentence">11  But the king will rejoice in God.
Every person swearing by Him will exult,For the mouth of those speaking lies will be silenced.</span></p></level1>
