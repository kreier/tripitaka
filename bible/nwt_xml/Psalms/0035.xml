<level1><h1 id="p506">Psalm 35 Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p507" class="sentence">O Jehovah, defend my case against my opposers;Fight against those who fight against me.</span>
<span id="p508" class="sentence">2  Take up your buckler and large shield,And rise up to my defense.</span>
<span id="p509" class="sentence">3  Lift up your spear and battle-ax against my pursuers.
Say to me: “I am your salvation.”</span>
<span id="p510" class="sentence">4  May those who are hunting for my life be put to shame and humiliated.
May those who are plotting to destroy me retreat in disgrace.</span>
<span id="p511" class="sentence">5  May they become like chaff in the wind;May Jehovah’s angel drive them away.</span>
<span id="p512" class="sentence">6  May their path be dark and slipperyAs Jehovah’s angel pursues them.</span>
<span id="p513" class="sentence">7  For without cause they have hidden a net to trap me;Without cause they have dug a pit for me.</span>
<span id="p514" class="sentence">8  May disaster come upon him by surprise;May the net that he hid catch him;May he fall into it and be destroyed.</span>
<span id="p515" class="sentence">9  But I will rejoice in Jehovah;I will be joyful in his acts of salvation.</span>
<span id="p516" class="sentence">10  All my bones will say:
“O Jehovah, who is like you?
You rescue the helpless from those who are stronger,The helpless and the poor from those who rob them.”</span>
<span id="p517" class="sentence">11  Malicious witnesses come forward,Asking me things I know nothing about.</span>
<span id="p518" class="sentence">12  They repay me with bad for good,Making me feel bereaved.</span>
<span id="p519" class="sentence">13  But when they were ill, I clothed myself with sackcloth;I afflicted myself by fasting,And when my prayer would return unanswered,</span>
<span id="p520" class="sentence">14  I walked about mourning as for a friend or a brother of mine;I bowed down in sorrow, like one mourning for his mother.</span>
<span id="p521" class="sentence">15  But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;They gathered together to strike me down in ambush;They tore me to pieces and did not keep silent.</span>
<span id="p522" class="sentence">16  The ungodly scornfully mock me,They grind their teeth against me.</span>
<span id="p523" class="sentence">17  O Jehovah, how long will you just look on?
Rescue me from their attacks,My precious life from the young lions.</span>
<span id="p524" class="sentence">18  Then I will give thanks to you in the great congregation;I will praise you among the throngs of people.</span>
<span id="p525" class="sentence">19  Do not let those who for no reason are my enemies gloat over me;Do not let those hating me without cause wink their eyes maliciously.</span>
<span id="p526" class="sentence">20  For they do not speak words of peace,But they deceptively scheme against the peaceful ones of the land.</span>
<span id="p527" class="sentence">21  They open their mouth wide to accuse me,Saying: “Aha! Aha! Our eyes have seen it.”</span>
<span id="p528" class="sentence">22  You have seen this, O Jehovah. Do not remain silent.
O Jehovah, do not stay far from me.</span>
<span id="p529" class="sentence">23  Awake and rise to my defense,My God, Jehovah, defend me in my legal case.</span>
<span id="p530" class="sentence">24  Judge me according to your righteousness, O Jehovah my God;Do not let them gloat over me.</span>
<span id="p531" class="sentence">25  May they never say to themselves: “Aha! We got what we wanted.”
May they never say: “We have swallowed him up.”</span>
<span id="p532" class="sentence">26  Let all of them be put to shame and disgraced,Those who gloat over my calamity.
Let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and humiliation.</span>
<span id="p533" class="sentence">27  But let those who take pleasure in my righteousness shout joyfully;May they constantly say:
“May Jehovah be magnified, who takes pleasure in the peace of his servant.”</span>
<span id="p534" class="sentence">28  Then my tongue will recount your righteousnessAnd praise you all day long.</span></p></level1>
