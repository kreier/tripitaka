<level1><h1 id="p155">Psalm 14 To the director. Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p156" class="sentence">The foolish one says in his heart:
“There is no Jehovah.”
Their actions are corrupt, and their dealings are detestable;No one is doing good.</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">2  But Jehovah looks down from heaven on the sons of menTo see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">3  They have all turned aside;They are all alike corrupt.
No one is doing good,Not even one.</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">4  Do none of the wrongdoers understand?
They devour my people as if they were eating bread.
They do not call on Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">5  But they will be filled with great terror,For Jehovah is with the generation of the righteous.</span>
<span id="p161" class="sentence">6  You wrongdoers try to frustrate the plans of the lowly one,But Jehovah is his refuge.</span>
<span id="p162" class="sentence">7  O that Israel’s salvation may come from Zion!
When Jehovah gathers back his captive people,Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.</span></p></level1>
