<level1><h1 id="p388">Psalm 28 Of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p389" class="sentence">To you I keep calling, O Jehovah my Rock;Do not turn a deaf ear to me.
If you keep silent toward me,I will become like those going down to the pit.</span>
<span id="p390" class="sentence">2  Hear my pleas when I cry to you for helpAs I lift up my hands toward the innermost room of your sanctuary.</span>
<span id="p391" class="sentence">3  Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those practicing what is hurtful,Those who are speaking words of peace with their fellow man while evil is in their hearts.</span>
<span id="p392" class="sentence">4  Pay them back for their deeds,According to their evil practices.
Repay them for the work of their hands,According to what they have done.</span>
<span id="p393" class="sentence">5  For they pay no attention to the activities of Jehovah,Nor to the work of his hands.
He will tear them down and not build them up.</span>
<span id="p394" class="sentence">6  May Jehovah be praised,For he has heard my pleas for help.</span>
<span id="p395" class="sentence">7  Jehovah is my strength and my shield;In him my heart trusts.
I have received his help, and my heart rejoices,So I will praise him with my song.</span>
<span id="p396" class="sentence">8  Jehovah is a strength for his people;He is a stronghold, bringing grand salvation to his anointed one.</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">9  Save your people, and bless your inheritance.
Shepherd them and carry them in your arms forever.</span></p></level1>
