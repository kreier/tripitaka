<level1><h1 id="p1818">Psalm 106</h1>
<p><span id="p1819" class="sentence">Praise Jah!
Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;His loyal love endures forever.</span>
<span id="p1820" class="sentence">2  Who can fully declare Jehovah’s mighty actsOr proclaim all his praiseworthy deeds?</span>
<span id="p1821" class="sentence">3  Happy are those who act with justice,Who always do what is right.</span>
<span id="p1822" class="sentence">4  Remember me, O Jehovah, when you show favor toward your people.
Take care of me with your acts of salvation,</span>
<span id="p1823" class="sentence">5  So that I may enjoy the goodness you show your chosen ones,That I may rejoice along with your nation,That I may proudly praise you along with your inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1824" class="sentence">6  We have sinned just as our forefathers did;We have done wrong; we have acted wickedly.</span>
<span id="p1825" class="sentence">7  Our forefathers in Egypt did not appreciate your wonderful works.
They did not remember your abundant loyal love,But they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.</span>
<span id="p1826" class="sentence">8  But he saved them for the sake of his name,To make his mightiness known.</span>
<span id="p1827" class="sentence">9  He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;He led them through its depths as through a desert;</span>
<span id="p1828" class="sentence">10  He saved them from the hand of their foeAnd reclaimed them from the hand of the enemy.</span>
<span id="p1829" class="sentence">11  The waters covered their adversaries;Not one of them survived.</span>
<span id="p1830" class="sentence">12  Then they had faith in his promise;They began to sing his praise.</span>
<span id="p1831" class="sentence">13  But they quickly forgot what he did;They did not wait for his counsel.</span>
<span id="p1832" class="sentence">14  They gave way to their selfish desires in the wilderness;They tested God in the desert.</span>
<span id="p1833" class="sentence">15  He gave them what they requested,But then struck them with disease that made them waste away.</span>
<span id="p1834" class="sentence">16  In the camp they grew jealous of MosesAnd of Aaron, the holy one of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1835" class="sentence">17  The earth then opened up and swallowed DaʹthanAnd covered those assembled with A·biʹram.</span>
<span id="p1836" class="sentence">18  A fire blazed among their group;A flame consumed the wicked.</span>
<span id="p1837" class="sentence">19  They made a calf in HorʹebAnd bowed down to a statue of metal;</span>
<span id="p1838" class="sentence">20  They exchanged my gloryFor the representation of a grass-eating bull.</span>
<span id="p1839" class="sentence">21  They forgot God their Savior,Who did great things in Egypt,</span>
<span id="p1840" class="sentence">22  Wonderful works in the land of Ham,Awe-inspiring deeds at the Red Sea.</span>
<span id="p1841" class="sentence">23  He was about to order their annihilation,But Moses his chosen one interceded with himTo avert his destructive anger.</span>
<span id="p1842" class="sentence">24  Then they despised the desirable land;They had no faith in his promise.</span>
<span id="p1843" class="sentence">25  They kept grumbling in their tents;They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1844" class="sentence">26  So he raised his hand in an oath concerning themThat he would make them fall in the wilderness;</span>
<span id="p1845" class="sentence">27  He would make their descendants fall among the nations,And he would scatter them throughout the lands.</span>
<span id="p1846" class="sentence">28  Then they joined in worship of Baʹal of Peʹor,And they ate sacrifices offered to the dead.</span>
<span id="p1847" class="sentence">29  They provoked Him by their actions,And a scourge broke out among them.</span>
<span id="p1848" class="sentence">30  But when Phinʹe·has stood up and intervened,The scourge was halted.</span>
<span id="p1849" class="sentence">31  And it was counted to him as righteousnessThrough all generations forever.</span>
<span id="p1850" class="sentence">32  They provoked Him at the waters of Merʹi·bah,And it went badly for Moses because of them.</span>
<span id="p1851" class="sentence">33  They embittered his spirit,And he spoke rashly with his lips.</span>
<span id="p1852" class="sentence">34  They did not annihilate the peoples,As Jehovah had commanded them.</span>
<span id="p1853" class="sentence">35  But they mingled with the nationsAnd adopted their ways.</span>
<span id="p1854" class="sentence">36  They kept serving their idols,And these became a snare to them.</span>
<span id="p1855" class="sentence">37  They would sacrifice their sonsAnd their daughters to demons.</span>
<span id="p1856" class="sentence">38  They kept spilling innocent blood,The blood of their own sons and daughtersWhom they sacrificed to the idols of Caʹnaan;And the land was polluted with bloodshed.</span>
<span id="p1857" class="sentence">39  They became unclean by their works;They committed spiritual prostitution by their deeds.</span>
<span id="p1858" class="sentence">40  So the anger of Jehovah blazed against his people,And he grew to detest his inheritance.</span>
<span id="p1859" class="sentence">41  He repeatedly handed them over to the nations,So that those who hated them might rule over them.</span>
<span id="p1860" class="sentence">42  Their enemies oppressed them,And they were subject to their power.</span>
<span id="p1861" class="sentence">43  Many times he rescued them,But they would rebel and disobey,And they would be brought low for their error.</span>
<span id="p1862" class="sentence">44  But he would see their distressAnd hear their cry for help.</span>
<span id="p1863" class="sentence">45  For their sake he would remember his covenant,And he would feel pity, moved by his great loyal love.</span>
<span id="p1864" class="sentence">46  He would cause them to be pitiedBy all who held them captive.</span>
<span id="p1865" class="sentence">47  Save us, O Jehovah our God,And gather us from the nationsSo that we may give thanks to your holy nameAnd exult in praising you.</span>
<span id="p1866" class="sentence">48  May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praisedThroughout all eternity.
And let all the people say, “Amen!”
Praise Jah!</span></p></level1>
