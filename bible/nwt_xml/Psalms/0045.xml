<level1><h1 id="p703">Psalm 45 To the director; set to “The Lilies.” Of the sons of Korʹah. Masʹkil. A song of love.</h1>
<p><span id="p704" class="sentence">My heart is stirred by something good.
I say: “My song is about a king.”
May my tongue be the stylus of a skilled copyist.</span>
<span id="p705" class="sentence">2  You are the most handsome of the sons of men.
Gracious speech flows from your lips.
That is why God has blessed you forever.</span>
<span id="p706" class="sentence">3  Strap your sword on your side, O mighty one,In your dignity and your splendor.</span>
<span id="p707" class="sentence">4  And in your splendor go on to victory;Ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness,And your right hand will accomplish awe-inspiring things.</span>
<span id="p708" class="sentence">5  Your arrows are sharp, making peoples fall before you;They pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies.</span>
<span id="p709" class="sentence">6  God is your throne forever and ever;The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness.</span>
<span id="p710" class="sentence">7  You loved righteousness, and you hated wickedness.
That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.</span>
<span id="p711" class="sentence">8  All your garments are scented with myrrh and aloeswood and cassia;From the grand ivory palace, stringed instruments make you rejoice.</span>
<span id="p712" class="sentence">9  The daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor.
The royal consort has taken her stand at your right hand, adorned in gold of Oʹphir.</span>
<span id="p713" class="sentence">10  Listen, O daughter, pay attention and incline your ear;Forget your people and your father’s house.</span>
<span id="p714" class="sentence">11  And the king will long for your beauty,For he is your lord,So bow down to him.</span>
<span id="p715" class="sentence">12  The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;The wealthiest of men will seek your favor.</span>
<span id="p716" class="sentence">13  Inside the palace the king’s daughter is absolutely magnificent;Her clothing is adorned with gold.</span>
<span id="p717" class="sentence">14  She will be brought to the king in richly woven garments.
The virgin companions following her are brought in before you.</span>
<span id="p718" class="sentence">15  They will be brought with rejoicing and joy;They will enter into the king’s palace.</span>
<span id="p719" class="sentence">16  Your sons will take the place of your forefathers.
You will appoint them as princes in all the earth.</span>
<span id="p720" class="sentence">17  I will make your name known throughout all generations to come.
That is why peoples will praise you forever and ever.</span></p></level1>
