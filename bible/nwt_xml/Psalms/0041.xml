<level1><h1 id="p644">Psalm 41 To the director. A melody of David.</h1>
<p><span id="p645" class="sentence">Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one;Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity.</span>
<span id="p646" class="sentence">2  Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive.
He will be pronounced happy in the earth;You will never turn him over to the will of his enemies.</span>
<span id="p647" class="sentence">3  Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed;During his sickness you will completely change his bed.</span>
<span id="p648" class="sentence">4  For I said: “O Jehovah, show me favor.
Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”</span>
<span id="p649" class="sentence">5  But my enemies speak evil about me:
“When will he die and his name perish?”</span>
<span id="p650" class="sentence">6  If one of them comes to see me, his heart speaks falsely.
He gathers something harmful to say;Then he goes out and spreads it abroad.</span>
<span id="p651" class="sentence">7  All those who hate me whisper to one another;They are scheming something bad against me:</span>
<span id="p652" class="sentence">8  “A dreadful thing has overtaken him;Now that he is down, he will not rise again.”</span>
<span id="p653" class="sentence">9  Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted,Who was eating my bread, has lifted his heel against me.</span>
<span id="p654" class="sentence">10  But you, O Jehovah, show me favor and raise me up,So that I may repay them.</span>
<span id="p655" class="sentence">11  By this I will know that you are pleased with me:
When my enemy cannot shout in triumph over me.</span>
<span id="p656" class="sentence">12  As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity;You will keep me in your presence forever.</span>
<span id="p657" class="sentence">13  May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praisedThroughout all eternity.
Amen and Amen.</span></p></level1>
