<level1><h1 id="p2344">Psalm 132 A Song of the Ascents.</h1>
<p><span id="p2345" class="sentence">O Jehovah, remember DavidAnd all his suffering;</span>
<span id="p2346" class="sentence">2  How he swore to Jehovah,How he vowed to the Powerful One of Jacob:</span>
<span id="p2347" class="sentence">3  “I will not go into my tent, my home.
I will not lie upon my couch, my bed;</span>
<span id="p2348" class="sentence">4  I will not allow my eyes to sleep,Nor my eyelids to slumber</span>
<span id="p2349" class="sentence">5  Until I find a place for Jehovah,A fine residence for the Powerful One of Jacob.”</span>
<span id="p2350" class="sentence">6  Look! We heard about it in Ephʹra·thah;We found it in the fields of the forest.</span>
<span id="p2351" class="sentence">7  Let us come into his residence;Let us bow down at his footstool.</span>
<span id="p2352" class="sentence">8  Rise up, O Jehovah, to come to your resting-place,You and the Ark of your strength.</span>
<span id="p2353" class="sentence">9  May your priests be clothed with righteousness,And may your loyal ones shout joyfully.</span>
<span id="p2354" class="sentence">10  For the sake of David your servant,Do not reject your anointed one.</span>
<span id="p2355" class="sentence">11  Jehovah has sworn to David;He will surely not go back on his word:
“One of your offspring,I will place on your throne.</span>
<span id="p2356" class="sentence">12  If your sons keep my covenantAnd my reminders that I teach them,Their sons tooWill sit on your throne forever.”</span>
<span id="p2357" class="sentence">13  For Jehovah has chosen Zion;He has desired it for his dwelling place:</span>
<span id="p2358" class="sentence">14  “This is my resting-place forever;Here I will dwell, for this is my desire.</span>
<span id="p2359" class="sentence">15  I will richly bless it with provisions;I will satisfy its poor with bread.</span>
<span id="p2360" class="sentence">16  Its priests I will clothe with salvation,And its loyal ones will shout joyfully.</span>
<span id="p2361" class="sentence">17  There I will make the strength of David grow.
I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one.</span>
<span id="p2362" class="sentence">18  I will clothe his enemies with shame,But the crown on his head will flourish.”</span></p></level1>
