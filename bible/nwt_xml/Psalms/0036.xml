<level1><h1 id="p535">Psalm 36 To the director. Of Jehovah’s servant, David.</h1>
<p><span id="p536" class="sentence">Transgression speaks to the wicked one deep within his heart;There is no fear of God before his eyes.</span>
<span id="p537" class="sentence">2  For in his own eyes he flatters himself too muchTo detect and hate his error.</span>
<span id="p538" class="sentence">3  The words of his mouth are hurtful and deceptive;He shows no insight for doing what is good.</span>
<span id="p539" class="sentence">4  He plots hurtful schemes even on his bed.
He is set on a path that is not good;He does not reject what is bad.</span>
<span id="p540" class="sentence">5  O Jehovah, your loyal love reaches to the heavens,Your faithfulness up to the clouds.</span>
<span id="p541" class="sentence">6  Your righteousness is like majestic mountains;Your judgments are like vast, deep waters.
Man and beast you preserve, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p542" class="sentence">7  How precious your loyal love is, O God!
In the shadow of your wings, the sons of men take refuge.</span>
<span id="p543" class="sentence">8  They drink their fill of the rich bounty of your house,And you cause them to drink of the torrent of your delights.</span>
<span id="p544" class="sentence">9  With you is the source of life;By your light we can see light.</span>
<span id="p545" class="sentence">10  Continue showing your loyal love to those who know you,And your righteousness, to the upright in heart.</span>
<span id="p546" class="sentence">11  Do not let the foot of the haughty tread on meOr the hand of the wicked drive me away.</span>
<span id="p547" class="sentence">12  There the wrongdoers have fallen;They have been knocked down and cannot get up.</span></p></level1>
