<level1><h1 id="p63">Psalm 7 A dirge of David that he sang to Jehovah regarding the words of Cush the Benʹja·min·ite.</h1>
<p><span id="p64" class="sentence">O Jehovah my God, in you I have taken refuge.
Save me from all those persecuting me and rescue me.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">2  Otherwise they will tear me to pieces as a lion does,Carrying me off with no one to rescue me.</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">3  O Jehovah my God, if I am at fault in this,If I have acted unjustly,</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">4  If I have wronged the one doing good to me,Or if I have plundered my enemy without cause,</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">5  Then let an enemy pursue and overtake me;Let him trample my life down to the earthAnd cause my glory to perish in the dust. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">6  Rise up in your anger, O Jehovah;Stand up against the fury of my enemies;Awake for me, and demand that justice be done.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">7  Let the nations surround you;And you will act against them from on high.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">8  Jehovah will pass sentence on the peoples.
Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousnessAnd according to my integrity.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">9  Please put an end to the evil deeds of the wicked.
But establish the righteous,Since you are the righteous God who examines the hearts and the deepest emotions.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">10  God is my shield, the Savior of those upright in heart.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">11  God is a righteous Judge,And God proclaims his judgments every day.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">12  If anyone will not repent, He sharpens his sword;He bends his bow and makes it ready.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">13  He prepares his deadly weapons;He makes ready his flaming arrows.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">14  Look at the one who is pregnant with wickedness;He conceives trouble and gives birth to lies.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">15  He excavates a pit and digs it deep,But he falls into the very hole he made.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">16  The trouble he causes will return on his own head;His violence will fall on the crown of his head.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">17  I will praise Jehovah for his justice;I will sing praises to the name of Jehovah the Most High.</span></p></level1>
