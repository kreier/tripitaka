<p><span id="p1868" class="sentence">Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;His loyal love endures forever.</span>
<span id="p1869" class="sentence">2  Let those reclaimed by Jehovah say this,Those whom he reclaimed from the hand of the adversary,</span>
<span id="p1870" class="sentence">3  Whom he gathered together from the lands,From the east and from the west,From the north and from the south.</span>
<span id="p1871" class="sentence">4  They wandered about in the wilderness, in the desert;They did not find a way to a city where they could live.</span>
<span id="p1872" class="sentence">5  They were hungry and thirsty;They were faint from exhaustion.</span>
<span id="p1873" class="sentence">6  They kept crying out to Jehovah in their distress;He rescued them from their plight.</span>
<span id="p1874" class="sentence">7  He had them walk in the right wayTo come to a city where they could live.</span>
<span id="p1875" class="sentence">8  Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal loveAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p1876" class="sentence">9  For he has satisfied the thirstyAnd filled the hungry with good things.</span>
<span id="p1877" class="sentence">10  Some were living in deepest darkness,Prisoners in affliction and in irons.</span>
<span id="p1878" class="sentence">11  For they had rebelled against the word of God;They disrespected the counsel of the Most High.</span>
<span id="p1879" class="sentence">12  So he humbled their hearts through hardship;They stumbled, and there was no one to help them.</span>
<span id="p1880" class="sentence">13  They called to Jehovah for help in their distress;He saved them from their plight.</span>
<span id="p1881" class="sentence">14  He brought them out of deepest darkness,And he tore off their shackles.</span>
<span id="p1882" class="sentence">15  Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal loveAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p1883" class="sentence">16  For he has broken down the doors of copperAnd cut through the bars of iron.</span>
<span id="p1884" class="sentence">17  They were foolish and suffered afflictionOn account of their transgressions and their errors.</span>
<span id="p1885" class="sentence">18  They lost their appetite for all food;They drew near the gates of death.</span>
<span id="p1886" class="sentence">19  They would call to Jehovah for help in their distress;He would save them from their plight.</span>
<span id="p1887" class="sentence">20  He would send his word and heal themAnd rescue them from the pits they were trapped in.</span>
<span id="p1888" class="sentence">21  Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal loveAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p1889" class="sentence">22  Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgivingAnd declare his works with a joyful cry.</span>
<span id="p1890" class="sentence">23  Those who travel on the sea in ships,Who ply their trade over the vast waters,</span>
<span id="p1891" class="sentence">24  They have seen the works of JehovahAnd his wonderful works in the deep;</span>
<span id="p1892" class="sentence">25  How by his word a windstorm arises,Lifting up the waves of the sea.</span>
<span id="p1893" class="sentence">26  They rise up to the sky;They plunge down to the depths.
Their courage melts away because of the impending calamity.</span>
<span id="p1894" class="sentence">27  They reel and stagger like a drunken man,And all their skill proves useless.</span>
<span id="p1895" class="sentence">28  Then they cry out to Jehovah in their distress,And he rescues them from their plight.</span>
<span id="p1896" class="sentence">29  He calms the windstorm;The waves of the sea grow quiet.</span>
<span id="p1897" class="sentence">30  They rejoice when these grow still,And he leads them to their desired harbor.</span>
<span id="p1898" class="sentence">31  Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal loveAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p1899" class="sentence">32  Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people,And let them praise him in the council of the elders.</span>
<span id="p1900" class="sentence">33  He turns rivers into a desertAnd springs of water into parched ground,</span>
<span id="p1901" class="sentence">34  Fruitful land into salty wasteland,Because of the wickedness of those dwelling in it.</span>
<span id="p1902" class="sentence">35  He turns the desert into reedy pools of water,And dry land into springs of water.</span>
<span id="p1903" class="sentence">36  He causes the hungry to dwell there,So that they may establish a city where they can live.</span>
<span id="p1904" class="sentence">37  They sow fields and plant vineyardsThat yield fruitful crops.</span>
<span id="p1905" class="sentence">38  He blesses them and they increase greatly;He does not let their cattle diminish.</span>
<span id="p1906" class="sentence">39  But again they become few and are humiliatedBecause of oppression, calamity, and grief.</span>
<span id="p1907" class="sentence">40  He pours out contempt upon noblesAnd makes them wander in trackless wastelands.</span>
<span id="p1908" class="sentence">41  But he protects the poor from oppressionAnd makes their families as numerous as a flock.</span>
<span id="p1909" class="sentence">42  The upright see this and rejoice;But all the unrighteous shut their mouths.</span>
<span id="p1910" class="sentence">43  Whoever is wise will observe these thingsAnd will carefully consider Jehovah’s acts of loyal love.</span></p></level1>
