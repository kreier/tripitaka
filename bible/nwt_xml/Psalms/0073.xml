<level1><h1 id="p1154">Psalm 73 A melody of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p1155" class="sentence">God is truly good to Israel, to those pure in heart.</span>
<span id="p1156" class="sentence">2  As for me, my feet had almost strayed;My steps had nearly slipped.</span>
<span id="p1157" class="sentence">3  For I became envious of the arrogantWhen I would see the peace of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p1158" class="sentence">4  For they have no pain in their death;Their bodies are healthy.</span>
<span id="p1159" class="sentence">5  They are not troubled like other humans,Nor do they suffer like other men.</span>
<span id="p1160" class="sentence">6  Therefore, haughtiness is their necklace;Violence clothes them as a garment.</span>
<span id="p1161" class="sentence">7  Their prosperity makes their eyes bulge;They have exceeded the imaginations of the heart.</span>
<span id="p1162" class="sentence">8  They scoff and say evil things.
They arrogantly threaten oppression.</span>
<span id="p1163" class="sentence">9  They speak as if they were as high as heaven,And their tongues swagger about in the earth.</span>
<span id="p1164" class="sentence">10  So his people turn aside to them,And they drink from their abundant water.</span>
<span id="p1165" class="sentence">11  They say: “How does God know?
Does the Most High really have knowledge?”</span>
<span id="p1166" class="sentence">12  Yes, these are the wicked, who always have it easy.
They keep increasing their wealth.</span>
<span id="p1167" class="sentence">13  Surely in vain I have kept my heart pureAnd washed my hands in innocence.</span>
<span id="p1168" class="sentence">14  And I was troubled all day long;Every morning I was chastised.</span>
<span id="p1169" class="sentence">15  But if I had said these things,I would have betrayed your people.</span>
<span id="p1170" class="sentence">16  When I tried to understand it,It was troubling to me</span>
<span id="p1171" class="sentence">17  Until I entered the grand sanctuary of God,And I discerned their future.</span>
<span id="p1172" class="sentence">18  Surely you place them on slippery ground.
You make them fall to their ruin.</span>
<span id="p1173" class="sentence">19  How suddenly they are devastated!
How sudden is their finish as they come to a terrible end!</span>
<span id="p1174" class="sentence">20  Like a dream when one wakes up, O Jehovah,When you rouse yourself, you will dismiss their image.</span>
<span id="p1175" class="sentence">21  But my heart was sour,And deep inside I felt sharp pain.</span>
<span id="p1176" class="sentence">22  I was unreasoning and lacked understanding;I was like a senseless beast before you.</span>
<span id="p1177" class="sentence">23  But now I am continually with you;You have taken hold of my right hand.</span>
<span id="p1178" class="sentence">24  You guide me with your advice,And afterward you will lead me to glory.</span>
<span id="p1179" class="sentence">25  Whom do I have in the heavens?
And besides you I desire nothing on earth.</span>
<span id="p1180" class="sentence">26  My body and my heart may fail,But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.</span>
<span id="p1181" class="sentence">27  Truly, those keeping far from you will perish.
You will put an end to everyone who immorally leaves you.</span>
<span id="p1182" class="sentence">28  But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me.
I have made the Sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge,To declare all your works.</span></p></level1>
