<level1><h1 id="p112">Psalm 10 ל []</h1>
<p><span id="p113" class="sentence">Why, O Jehovah, do you stand at a distance?
Why do you hide yourself in times of distress?</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">2  The wicked one arrogantly pursues the helpless one,But he will be caught in the schemes he devises.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">3  For the wicked one boasts about his selfish desiresAnd blesses the greedy one;נ [Nun]He disrespects Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">4  In his haughtiness, the wicked man makes no investigation;All his thoughts are: “There is no God.”</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">5  His ways keep prospering,But your judgments are beyond his understanding;He scoffs at all his adversaries.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">6  He says in his heart: “I will never be shaken;For generation after generationI will never see calamity.”</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">7  His mouth is full of curses, lies, and threats;Under his tongue are trouble and injury.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">8  He waits in ambush near the settlements;From his hiding place he kills an innocent one.
ע [Ayin]
His eyes are watching for an unfortunate victim.</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">9  He waits in his hiding place like a lion in its lair.
He waits to seize the helpless one.
He seizes the helpless one when he pulls his net shut.</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">10  The victim is crushed and brought down;The unfortunate ones fall into his clutches.</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">11  He says in his heart: “God has forgotten.
He has turned away his face.
He never notices.”</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">12  Rise up, O Jehovah. O God, lift up your hand.
Do not forget the helpless ones.</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">13  Why has the wicked one disrespected God?
He says in his heart: “You will not hold me accountable.”</span>
<span id="p126" class="sentence">14  But you do see trouble and distress.
You look on and take matters in hand.
To you the unfortunate victim turns;You are the helper for the fatherless child.</span>
<span id="p127" class="sentence">15  Break the arm of the wicked and evil man,So that when you search for his wickedness,You will find it no more.</span>
<span id="p128" class="sentence">16  Jehovah is King forever and ever.
The nations have perished from the earth.</span>
<span id="p129" class="sentence">17  But you will hear the request of the meek, O Jehovah.
You will make their hearts firm and pay close attention to them.</span>
<span id="p130" class="sentence">18  You will render justice to the fatherless and to those who are crushed,So that mortal man of the earth may no longer make them afraid.</span></p></level1>
