<level1><h1 id="p658">Psalm 42 To the director. Masʹkil of the sons of Korʹah.</h1>
<p><span id="p659" class="sentence">As a deer that longs for streams of water,So I long for you, O God.</span>
<span id="p660" class="sentence">2  I do thirst for God, for the living God.
When may I come and appear before God?</span>
<span id="p661" class="sentence">3  My tears are my food day and night;All day long people taunt me: “Where is your God?”</span>
<span id="p662" class="sentence">4  These things I remember, and I pour out my soul,For I once walked along with the multitude;I used to walk solemnly before them to the house of God,With sounds of rejoicing and thanksgiving,Those of a crowd celebrating a festival.</span>
<span id="p663" class="sentence">5  Why am I in despair?
Why is this turmoil within me?
Wait for God,For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior.</span>
<span id="p664" class="sentence">6  My God, I am in despair.
That is why I remember you,From the land of Jordan and the peaks of Herʹmon,From Mount Mi·zarʹ.</span>
<span id="p665" class="sentence">7  Deep waters call to deep watersAt the sound of your waterfalls.
All your surging waves have overwhelmed me.</span>
<span id="p666" class="sentence">8  By day Jehovah will grant me his loyal love,And by night his song will be with me—a prayer to the God of my life.</span>
<span id="p667" class="sentence">9  I will say to God, my crag:
“Why have you forgotten me?
Why should I walk about sad because of the oppression by my enemy?”</span>
<span id="p668" class="sentence">10  With murderous hostility my enemies taunt me;All day long they taunt me: “Where is your God?”</span>
<span id="p669" class="sentence">11  Why am I in despair?
Why is this turmoil within me?
Wait for God,For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior and my God.</span></p></level1>
