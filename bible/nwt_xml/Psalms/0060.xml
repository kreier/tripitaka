<level1><h1 id="p928">Psalm 60 To the director; set to “The Lily of Reminder.” Mikʹtam. Of David. For teaching. When he fought with Aʹram-na·ha·raʹim and Aʹram-Zoʹbah, and Joʹab returned and struck down 12,000 Eʹdom·ites in the Valley of Salt.</h1>
<p><span id="p929" class="sentence">O God, you rejected us; you broke through our defenses.
You were angry with us; but now accept us back!</span>
<span id="p930" class="sentence">2  You caused the earth to quake; you split it open.
Repair its breaches, for it is falling.</span>
<span id="p931" class="sentence">3  You caused your people to suffer hardship.
You made us drink wine that makes us stagger.</span>
<span id="p932" class="sentence">4  Give a signal to those fearing youTo flee and dodge the bow. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p933" class="sentence">5  So that your loved ones may be rescued,Save us with your right hand and answer us.</span>
<span id="p934" class="sentence">6  God has spoken in his holiness:
“I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem as an inheritance,And I will measure off the Valley of Sucʹcoth.</span>
<span id="p935" class="sentence">7  Gilʹe·ad belongs to me, as does Ma·nasʹseh,And Eʹphra·im is the helmet for my head;Judah is my commander’s staff.</span>
<span id="p936" class="sentence">8  Moʹab is my washbasin.
Over Eʹdom I will throw my sandal.
Over Phi·lisʹti·a I will shout in triumph.”</span>
<span id="p937" class="sentence">9  Who will bring me to the besieged city?
Who will lead me as far as Eʹdom?</span>
<span id="p938" class="sentence">10  Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us,Our God, who no longer goes out with our armies?</span>
<span id="p939" class="sentence">11  Help us in our distress,For salvation by humans is worthless.</span>
<span id="p940" class="sentence">12  By God we will gain power,And he will trample on our adversaries.</span></p></level1>
