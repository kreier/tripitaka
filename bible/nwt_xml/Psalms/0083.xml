<level1><h1 id="p1385">Psalm 83 A song. A melody of Aʹsaph.</h1>
<p><span id="p1386" class="sentence">O God, do not be silent;Do not keep quiet or still, O Divine One.</span>
<span id="p1387" class="sentence">2  For look! your enemies are in an uproar;Those who hate you act arrogantly.</span>
<span id="p1388" class="sentence">3  With cunning they secretly plot against your people;They conspire against your treasured ones.</span>
<span id="p1389" class="sentence">4  They say: “Come, let us annihilate them as a nation,So that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”</span>
<span id="p1390" class="sentence">5  They devise a unified strategy;They have made an alliance against you—</span>
<span id="p1391" class="sentence">6  The tents of Eʹdom and the Ishʹma·el·ites, Moʹab and the Hagʹrites,</span>
<span id="p1392" class="sentence">7  Geʹbal and Amʹmon and Amʹa·lek,Phi·lisʹti·a together with the inhabitants of Tyre.</span>
<span id="p1393" class="sentence">8  As·syrʹi·a too has joined them;They give support to the sons of Lot. (Selah)</span>
<span id="p1394" class="sentence">9  Do to them as you did to Midʹi·an,As you did to Sisʹe·ra and Jaʹbin at the stream of Kiʹshon.</span>
<span id="p1395" class="sentence">10  They were annihilated at En-dor;They became manure for the ground.</span>
<span id="p1396" class="sentence">11  Make their nobles like Oʹreb and ZeʹebAnd their princes like Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna,</span>
<span id="p1397" class="sentence">12  For they said: “Let us take possession of the land where God dwells.”</span>
<span id="p1398" class="sentence">13  O my God, make them like a whirling thistle,Like stubble blown about by the wind.</span>
<span id="p1399" class="sentence">14  Like a fire that burns up the forest,Like a flame that scorches the mountains,</span>
<span id="p1400" class="sentence">15  So may you pursue them with your tempestAnd terrify them with your windstorm.</span>
<span id="p1401" class="sentence">16  Cover their faces with dishonor,So that they may search for your name, O Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p1402" class="sentence">17  May they be put to shame and be terrified forever;May they be disgraced and perish;</span>
<span id="p1403" class="sentence">18  May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah,You alone are the Most High over all the earth.</span></p></level1>
