<level1><h1 id="p103">Chapter 5</h1>
<p><span id="p104" class="sentence">Therefore, become imitators of God, as beloved children,</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">2  and go on walking in love, just as the Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice, a sweet fragrance to God.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">3  Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as is proper for holy people;</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">4  neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting—things that are not befitting—but rather the giving of thanks.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">5  For you know this, recognizing it for yourselves, that no sexually immoral person or unclean person or greedy person, which means being an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of the Christ and of God.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">6  Let no man deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">7  Therefore, do not be sharers with them;</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">8  for you were once darkness, but you are now light in connection with the Lord. Go on walking as children of light,</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">9  for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">10  Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord;</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">11  and stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness; rather, expose them for what they are.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">12  For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention.</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">13  Now all the things that are being exposed are made evident by the light, for everything that is being made evident is light.</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">14  Therefore, it is said: “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and the Christ will shine upon you.”</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">15  So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons,</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">16  making the best use of your time, because the days are wicked.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">17  On this account stop being unreasonable, but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">18  Also, do not get drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery, but keep getting filled with spirit.</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">19  Speak to one another with psalms, praises to God, and spiritual songs, singing and accompanying yourselves with music in your hearts to Jehovah,</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">20  always giving thanks to our God and Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">21  Be in subjection to one another in fear of Christ.</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">22  Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord,</span>
<span id="p126" class="sentence">23  because a husband is head of his wife just as the Christ is head of the congregation, he being a savior of this body.</span>
<span id="p127" class="sentence">24  In fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the Christ, wives should also be to their husbands in everything.</span>
<span id="p128" class="sentence">25  Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it,</span>
<span id="p129" class="sentence">26  in order that he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word,</span>
<span id="p130" class="sentence">27  so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things, but holy and without blemish.</span>
<span id="p131" class="sentence">28  In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself,</span>
<span id="p132" class="sentence">29  for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cherishes it, just as the Christ does the congregation,</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">30  because we are members of his body.</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">31  “For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh.”</span>
<span id="p135" class="sentence">32  This sacred secret is great. Now I am speaking about Christ and the congregation.</span>
<span id="p136" class="sentence">33  Nevertheless, each one of you must love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.</span></p></level1>
