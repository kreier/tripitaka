<p><span id="p138" class="sentence">Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous.</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">2  “Honor your father and your mother” is the first command with a promise:</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">3  “That it may go well with you and you may remain a long time on the earth.”</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">4  And fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">5  Slaves, be obedient to your human masters, with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your hearts, as to the Christ,</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">6  not only when being watched, just to please men, but as Christ’s slaves doing the will of God whole-souled.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">7  Slave with a good attitude, as to Jehovah and not to men,</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">8  for you know that whatever good each one does, he will receive this back from Jehovah, whether he is a slave or a freeman.</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">9  Also, you masters, keep treating them in the same way, not threatening, for you know that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no partiality with him.</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">10  Finally, go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength.</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">11  Put on the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil;</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">12  because we have a struggle, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">13  For this reason take up the complete suit of armor from God, so that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after you have accomplished everything, to stand firm.</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">14  Stand firm, therefore, with the belt of truth fastened around your waist, wearing the breastplate of righteousness,</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">15  and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace.</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">16  Besides all of this, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one’s burning arrows.</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">17  Also, accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">18  while with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit. And to that end stay awake, constantly making supplication in behalf of all the holy ones.</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">19  Pray also for me, that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth, so that I may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news,</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">20  for which I am acting as an ambassador in chains, and that I may speak about it with boldness, as I ought to speak.</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">21  Now so that you may also know about me and how I am doing, Tychʹi·cus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">22  I am sending him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts.</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">23  May the brothers have peace and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p161" class="sentence">24  May the undeserved kindness be with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptness.</span></p></level1>
