<level1><h1 id="p49">Chapter 4</h1>
<p><span id="p50" class="sentence">“Look! You are beautiful, my beloved.
Look! You are beautiful.
Your eyes are those of doves behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goatsStreaming down the mountains of Gilʹe·ad.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">2  Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheepThat have come up from being washed,All of them bearing twins,And not one has lost her young.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">3  Your lips are like a scarlet thread,And your speech is delightful.
Like a segment of pomegranateAre your cheeks behind your veil.</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">4  Your neck is like the tower of David,Built with courses of stoneUpon which are hung a thousand shields,All the circular shields of the mighty men.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">5  Your two breasts are like two fawns,The twins of a gazelle,That feed among the lilies.”</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">6  “Until the day grows breezy and the shadows flee,I will go my way to the mountain of myrrhAnd to the hill of frankincense.”</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">7  “You are altogether beautiful, my beloved,There is no blemish in you.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">8  Come with me from Lebʹa·non, my bride,Come with me from Lebʹa·non.
Descend from the peak of A·maʹnah,From the peak of Seʹnir, the peak of Herʹmon,From the lairs of lions, from the mountains of leopards.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">9  You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride,You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes,With one pendant of your necklace.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">10  How beautiful your expressions of affection are, my sister, my bride!
Your expressions of affection are far better than wine,And the fragrance of your perfume than any spice!</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">11  Your lips, my bride, drip with comb honey.
Honey and milk are under your tongue,And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebʹa·non.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">12  My sister, my bride, is like a locked garden,A locked garden, a spring sealed shut.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">13  Your shoots are a paradise of pomegranatesWith the choicest fruits, with henna along with spikenard plants,</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">14  Spikenard and saffron, cane and cinnamon,With all sorts of trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes,Along with all the finest perfumes.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">15  You are a garden spring, a well of fresh water,And flowing streams from Lebʹa·non.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">16  Awake, O north wind;Come in, O south wind.
Breathe upon my garden.
Let its fragrance spread.”
“Let my dear one come into his gardenAnd eat its choicest fruits.”</span></p></level1>
