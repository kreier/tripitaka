<p><span id="p112" class="sentence">“If only you were like my brother,Who nursed at my mother’s breasts!
Then if I found you outside, I would kiss you,And no one would despise me.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">2  I would lead you;I would bring you into the house of my mother,She who taught me.
I would give you spiced wine to drink,The fresh juice of pomegranates.</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">3  His left hand would be under my head,And his right hand would embrace me.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">4  I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem:
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.”</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">5  “Who is this coming up from the wilderness,Leaning upon her dear one?”
“Under the apple tree I awakened you.
There your mother was in labor with you.
There she who gave birth to you was in labor.</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">6  Place me as a seal upon your heart,As a seal upon your arm,For love is as strong as death is,And exclusive devotion is as unyielding as the Grave.
Its flames are a blazing fire, the flame of Jah.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">7  Surging waters cannot extinguish love,Nor can rivers wash it away.
If a man would offer all the wealth of his house for love,It would be utterly despised.”</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">8  “We have a little sister,And she has no breasts.
What will we do for our sisterOn the day when she is spoken for?”</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">9  “If she is a wall,We will build upon her a battlement of silver,But if she is a door,We will board her up with a cedar plank.”</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">10  “I am a wall,And my breasts are like towers.
So in his eyes I have becomeAs one who finds peace.</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">11  Solʹo·mon had a vineyard in Baʹal-haʹmon.
He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers.
Each one would bring in a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit.</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">12  I have my own vineyard at my disposal.
The thousand pieces of silver belong to you, O Solʹo·mon,And two hundred to those who care for its fruit.”</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">13  “O you who are dwelling in the gardens,The companions listen for your voice.
Let me hear it.”</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">14  “Hurry, my dear one,And be swift like a gazelleOr a young stagUpon the mountains of spices.”</span></p></level1>
