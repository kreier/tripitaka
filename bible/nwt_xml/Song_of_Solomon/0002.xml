<p><span id="p20" class="sentence">“I am but a saffron of the coastal plain,A lily of the valleys.”</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">2  “Like a lily among thornsIs my beloved among the daughters.”</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">3  “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,So is my dear one among the sons.
I passionately desire to sit in his shade,And his fruit is sweet to my taste.</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">4  He brought me into the banquet house,And his banner over me was love.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">5  Refresh me with raisin cakes;Sustain me with apples,For I am lovesick.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">6  His left hand is under my head,And his right hand embraces me.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">7  I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,By the gazelles and the does of the field:
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">8  The sound of my dear one!
Look! Here he comes,Climbing the mountains, leaping over the hills.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">9  My dear one is like a gazelle, like a young stag.
There he is, standing behind our wall,Gazing through the windows,Looking through the lattices.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">10  My dear one speaks, he says to me:
‘Rise up, my beloved,My beautiful one, come away with me.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">11  Look! The winter has passed.
The rains are over and gone.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">12  Blossoms have appeared in the land,The time of pruning has arrived,And the song of the turtledove is heard in our land.</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">13  The fig tree ripens its early figs;The vines are in blossom and give off their fragrance.
Rise up, my beloved, and come.
My beautiful one, come away with me.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">14  O my dove, in the retreats of the crag,In the recesses of the cliff,Let me see you and hear your voice,For your voice is pleasant and your appearance is lovely.’”</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">15  “Catch the foxes for us,The little foxes that ruin the vineyards,For our vineyards are in bloom.”</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">16  “My dear one is mine and I am his.
He is shepherding among the lilies.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">17  Until the day grows breezy and the shadows flee,Return quickly, O my dear one,Like the gazelle or the young stag upon the mountains of separation.</span></p></level1>
