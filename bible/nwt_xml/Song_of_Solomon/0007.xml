<level1><h1 id="p97">Chapter 7</h1>
<p><span id="p98" class="sentence">“How beautiful your feet are in your sandals,O noble daughter!
The curves of your thighs are like ornaments,The work of an artisan’s hands.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">2  Your navel is a round bowl.
May it never lack mixed wine.
Your belly is a heap of wheat,Encircled by lilies.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">3  Your two breasts are like two fawns,The twins of a gazelle.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">4  Your neck is like an ivory tower.
Your eyes are like the pools in Heshʹbon,By the gate of Bath-rabʹbim.
Your nose is like the tower of Lebʹa·non,Which looks toward Damascus.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">5  Your head crowns you like Carʹmel,And the locks of your hair are like purple wool.
The king is captivated by the flowing tresses.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">6  How beautiful you are, and how pleasant you are,O beloved girl, above all exquisite delights!</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">7  Your stature is like a palm tree,And your breasts are like date clusters.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">8  I said, ‘I will climb the palm treeTo take hold of its stalks of fruit.’
May your breasts be like clusters of grapes,Your breath as fragrant as apples,</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">9  And your mouth like the best wine.”
“May it go down smoothly for my dear one,Softly flowing over the lips of those asleep.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">10  I am my dear one’s,And his desire is for me.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">11  Come, O my dear one,Let us go out to the fields;Let us lodge among the henna plants.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">12  Let us rise early and go to the vineyardsTo see if the vine has sprouted,If the blossoms have opened,If the pomegranates are in bloom.
There I will express my affection for you.</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">13  The mandrakes give off their fragrance;At our doors are all sorts of choice fruits.
The new as well as the old,O my dear one, I have kept in store for you.</span></p></level1>
