<p><span id="p68" class="sentence">Meanwhile, the boy Samuel was ministering to Jehovah before Eʹli, but word from Jehovah had become rare in those days; visions were not widespread.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">2  One day Eʹli was lying down in his usual place, and his eyes had grown dim; he was not able to see.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">3  The lamp of God had not yet been extinguished, and Samuel was lying in the temple of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">4  Jehovah then called Samuel. He answered: “Here I am.”</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">5  He ran to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said: “I did not call. Lie down again.” So he went and lay down.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">6  Jehovah called once again: “Samuel!” At this Samuel got up and went to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said: “I did not call, my son. Lie down again.”</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">7  (Now Samuel had not yet come to know Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him.)</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">8  So Jehovah called again, a third time: “Samuel!” At that he got up and went to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.”
Eʹli then realized that it was Jehovah who was calling the boy.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">9  So Eʹli said to Samuel: “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you should say, ‘Speak, Jehovah, for your servant is listening.’” And Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">10  Jehovah came and stood there, and he called as at the other times: “Samuel, Samuel!” At this Samuel said: “Speak, for your servant is listening.”</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">11  Jehovah said to Samuel: “Look! I am doing something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">12  On that day I will carry out toward Eʹli all that I said about his house, from start to finish.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">13  You must tell him that I am bringing a lasting judgment on his house for the error that he has known about, for his sons are cursing God, but he has not rebuked them.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">14  That is why I have sworn to the house of Eʹli that the error of the house of Eʹli will never be atoned for by sacrifices or by offerings.”</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">15  Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of Jehovah’s house. Samuel was afraid to tell Eʹli of the vision.</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">16  But Eʹli called for Samuel: “Samuel, my son!” At this he said: “Here I am.”</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">17  He asked: “What message did he speak to you? Please, do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and add to it if you hide from me a single word of all that he said to you.”</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">18  So Samuel told him everything, and he did not hide anything from him. Eʹli said: “It is Jehovah. Let him do what is good in his eyes.”</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">19  Samuel continued growing up, and Jehovah himself was with him and did not let any of all his words go unfulfilled.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">20  All Israel from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba became aware that Samuel had been confirmed as Jehovah’s prophet.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">21  And Jehovah continued to appear in Shiʹloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiʹloh by the word of Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
