<level1><h1 id="p47">Chapter 3 א []</h1>
<p><span id="p48" class="sentence">I am the man who has seen affliction because of the rod of his fury.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">2  He has driven me out and makes me walk in darkness, not in light.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">3  Indeed, he repeatedly brings his hand against me all day long.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">4  He has worn away my flesh and my skin;He has broken my bones.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">5  He has besieged me; he has surrounded me with bitter poison and hardship.</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">6  He has forced me to sit in dark places, like men who died long ago.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">7  He has walled me in, so that I cannot escape;He has bound me with heavy copper fetters.</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">8  And when I cry out desperately for help, he rejects my prayer.</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">9  He has blocked up my paths with hewn stones;He has made my roadways crooked.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">10  He waits to ambush me like a bear, like a lion in hiding.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">11  He has forced me off the paths and torn me to pieces;He has made me desolate.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">12  He has bent his bow, and he sets me up as the target for the arrow.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">13  He has pierced my kidneys with the arrows of his quiver.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">14  I have become a laughingstock to all the peoples, the theme of their song all day long.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">15  He has filled me with bitter things and saturated me with wormwood.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">16  He breaks my teeth with gravel;He makes me cower in the ashes.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">17  You deprive me of peace; I have forgotten what is good.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">18  So I say: “My splendor has perished, as well as my expectation in Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">19  Remember my affliction and my homeless state, the wormwood and the bitter poison.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">20  You will surely remember and bow low over me.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">21  I recall this in my heart; that is why I will show a waiting attitude.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">22  It is because of Jehovah’s loyal love that we have not come to our finish,For his mercies never end.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">23  They are new each morning; your faithfulness is abundant.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">24  “Jehovah is my share,” I have said, “that is why I will show a waiting attitude for him.”</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">25  Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him, to the person who keeps seeking him.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">26  Good it is to wait in silence for the salvation of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">27  Good it is for a man to carry the yoke during his youth.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">28  Let him sit alone and keep silent when He lays it upon him.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">29  Let him put his mouth in the very dust; there may yet be hope.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">30  Let him give his cheek to the one striking him; let him have his fill of insults.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">31  For Jehovah will not cast us off forever.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">32  Although he has caused grief, he will also show mercy according to his abundant loyal love.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">33  For it is not in his heart to afflict or grieve the sons of men.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">34  To crush beneath one’s feet all the prisoners of the earth,</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">35  To deprive a man of justice in the presence of the Most High,</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">36  To defraud a man in his legal case—Jehovah does not tolerate such things.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">37  Who, then, can speak and have it happen unless Jehovah commands it?</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">38  From the mouth of the Most High,Bad things and good things do not go out together.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">39  Why should a living person complain about the consequences of his sin?</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">40  Let us examine and scrutinize our ways, and let us return to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">41  Let us lift up our hearts along with our hands to God in the heavens:</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">42  “We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">43  With anger you have blocked our approach;You have pursued and killed us without compassion.</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">44  You have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud, so that our prayer may not pass through.</span>
<span id="p92" class="sentence">45  You make us offscouring and refuse among the peoples.”</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">46  All our enemies open their mouths against us.</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">47  Dread and pitfalls have become our lot, desolation and breakdown.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">48  Streams of water flow from my eyes over the breakdown of the daughter of my people.</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">49  My eyes weep without ceasing, without pausing,</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">50  Until Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">51  My eyes have brought me grief because of all the daughters of my city.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">52  Without cause my enemies have hunted me down like a bird.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">53  They have silenced my life in the pit; they kept hurling stones at me.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">54  Waters flowed over my head, and I said: “I am finished!”</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">55  I called out your name, O Jehovah, from the depths of the pit.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">56  Hear my voice; do not shut your ear to my cry for help, for relief.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">57  You drew near in the day that I called you. You said: “Do not be afraid.”</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">58  You have defended my cause, O Jehovah, you have redeemed my life.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">59  You have seen, O Jehovah, the wrong done to me; please grant me justice.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">60  You have seen all their vengeance, all their schemes against me.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">61  You have heard their taunts, O Jehovah, all their schemes against me,</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">62  The lips of my opposers and their whispering against me all day long.</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">63  Look at them; whether they sit or stand, they mock me in their songs!</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">64  You will repay them, O Jehovah, according to their deeds.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">65  You will make them hardhearted, as your curse to them.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">66  You will pursue them in your anger and annihilate them from under the heavens of Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
