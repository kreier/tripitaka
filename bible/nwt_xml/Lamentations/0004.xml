<level1><h1 id="p114">Chapter 4 א []</h1>
<p><span id="p115" class="sentence">How the shining gold has grown dim, the fine gold!
How the holy stones lie scattered at every street corner!</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">2  As for the precious sons of Zion, who were weighed against refined gold,How they have been regarded as earthenware jars,The work of a potter’s hands!</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">3  Even jackals offer the udder to nurse their young,But the daughter of my people has become cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">4  The tongue of the nursing infant sticks to its palate because of thirst.
Children beg for bread, but no one gives them any.</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">5  Those who used to eat delicacies lie famished in the streets.
Those who were brought up wearing scarlet have embraced ash heaps.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">6  The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment for the sin of Sodʹom,Which was overthrown in a moment, with no hand to help her.</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">7  Her Nazʹi·rites were purer than snow, whiter than milk.
They were more ruddy than corals; they were like polished sapphires.</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">8  Their appearance has become darker than soot;They are not recognized in the streets.
Their skin has shriveled over their bones; it has become like dry wood.</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">9  Those slain with the sword are better off than those slain by famine,Those who waste away, who are pierced through for lack of food from the field.</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">10  The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children.
They have become their food of mourning during the breakdown of the daughter of my people.</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">11  Jehovah has expressed his wrath;He has poured out his burning anger.
And he starts a fire in Zion that consumes her foundations.</span>
<span id="p126" class="sentence">12  The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the productive land did not believeThat the adversary and the enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p127" class="sentence">13  It was because of the sins of her prophets, the errors of her priests,Who shed the blood of righteous ones in her midst.</span>
<span id="p128" class="sentence">14  They have wandered blindly in the streets.
They are polluted with blood,So that none are able to touch their garments.</span>
<span id="p129" class="sentence">15  “Go away! Unclean!” they call out to them. “Go away! Go away! Do not touch us!”
For they have gone homeless and wander about.
People have said among the nations: “They cannot stay here with us.</span>
<span id="p130" class="sentence">16  The face of Jehovah has scattered them;He will no longer look favorably on them.
Men will show no respect for the priests, no favor to the elders.”</span>
<span id="p131" class="sentence">17  Even now our eyes are worn out from looking in vain for help.
We looked and looked for help from a nation that could not save us.</span>
<span id="p132" class="sentence">18  They have hunted us down at every step so that we could not walk in our public squares.
Our end has drawn near; our days have finished, for our end has come.</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">19  Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.
They chased us on the mountains; they ambushed us in the wilderness.</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">20  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Jehovah, has been captured in their large pit,The one of whom we said: “In his shade we will live among the nations.”</span>
<span id="p135" class="sentence">21  Exult and rejoice, O daughter of Eʹdom, living as you do in the land of Uz.
But to you also the cup will be passed, and you will become drunk and expose your nakedness.</span>
<span id="p136" class="sentence">22  The punishment for your error, O daughter of Zion, has come to its finish.
He will not carry you off into exile again.
But he will turn his attention to your error, O daughter of Eʹdom.
He will uncover your sins.</span></p></level1>
