<p><span id="p138" class="sentence">Remember, O Jehovah, what has befallen us.
Look and see our disgrace.</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">2  Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">3  We have become orphans without a father; our mothers are like widows.</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">4  We must pay to drink our own water, and our own wood comes at a price.</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">5  Those pursuing us are at our neck;We are weary, but we are given no rest.</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">6  We hold out our hand to Egypt and to As·syrʹi·a, to get enough bread to eat.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">7  Our forefathers who sinned are no more, but we must bear their errors.</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">8  Servants now rule over us; there is no one to snatch us from their hand.</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">9  We bring in our bread at the risk of our life, because of the sword of the wilderness.</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">10  Our skin has become as hot as a furnace, because of the pangs of hunger.</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">11  The wives in Zion they have humiliated, the virgins in the cities of Judah.</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">12  Princes were hanged by their hand, and elders were shown no respect.</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">13  Young men carry the hand mill, and boys stumble under loads of wood.</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">14  The elders are gone from the city gate; young men do not play their music.</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">15  The joy is gone from our heart; our dancing has turned into mourning.</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">16  The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, because we have sinned!</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">17  Because of this our heart is sick,And because of these things our eyes have grown dim,</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">18  Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes now roam on it.</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">19  As for you, O Jehovah, you sit enthroned forever.
Your throne is for generation after generation.</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">20  Why do you forget us forever and abandon us for so long a time?</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">21  Bring us back to yourself, O Jehovah, and we will readily return to you.
Renew our days as in those of old.</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">22  However, you have utterly rejected us.
You remain intensely angry with us.</span></p></level1>
