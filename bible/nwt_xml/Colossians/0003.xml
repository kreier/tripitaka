<level1><h1 id="p55">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p56" class="sentence">If, however, you were raised up with the Christ, go on seeking the things above, where the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">2  Keep your minds fixed on the things above, not on the things on the earth.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">3  For you died, and your life has been hidden with the Christ in union with God.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">4  When the Christ, our life, is made manifest, then you also will be made manifest with him in glory.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">5  Deaden, therefore, your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness, which is idolatry.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">6  On account of those things the wrath of God is coming.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">7  That is how you too used to conduct yourselves in your former way of life.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">8  But now you must put them all away from you: wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">9  Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices,</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">10  and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it,</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">11  where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythʹi·an, slave, or freeman; but Christ is all things and in all.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">12  Accordingly, as God’s chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">13  Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">14  But besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">15  Also, let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts, for you were called to that peace in one body. And show yourselves thankful.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">16  Let the word of the Christ reside in you richly in all wisdom. Keep on teaching and encouraging one another with psalms, praises to God, spiritual songs sung with gratitude, singing in your hearts to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">17  Whatever it is that you do in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">18  You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">19  You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">20  You children, be obedient to your parents in everything, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">21  You fathers, do not be exasperating your children, so that they do not become downhearted.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">22  You slaves, be obedient in everything to those who are your human masters, not only when they are watching, just to please men, but with sincerity of heart, with fear of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">23  Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah, and not for men,</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">24  for you know that it is from Jehovah you will receive the inheritance as a reward. Slave for the Master, Christ.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">25  Certainly the one who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.</span></p></level1>
