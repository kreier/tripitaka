<p><span id="p622" class="sentence">Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Talk to the priests, Aaron’s sons, and say to them, ‘No one should defile himself for a dead person among his people.</span>
<span id="p623" class="sentence">2  But he may do so for a close blood relative, for his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,</span>
<span id="p624" class="sentence">3  and he may defile himself for his sister if she is a virgin who is near to him and has not yet married.</span>
<span id="p625" class="sentence">4  He may not defile himself and make himself profane for a woman who belongs to a husband of his people.</span>
<span id="p626" class="sentence">5  They should not make their heads bald or shave off the fringe of their beard or make cuts on their body.</span>
<span id="p627" class="sentence">6  They should be holy to their God, and they should not profane the name of their God, for they are presenting Jehovah’s offerings made by fire, the bread of their God, and they must be holy.</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">7  They should not marry a prostitute, a woman who has been defiled, or a woman divorced from her husband, because the priest is holy to his God.</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">8  You must sanctify him, because he is one presenting the bread of your God. He should be holy to you, because I, Jehovah, the one sanctifying you, am holy.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">9  “‘Now if the daughter of a priest should profane herself by committing prostitution, she is profaning her father. She should be burned in the fire.</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">10  “‘The high priest of his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been installed to wear the priestly garments, should not let his head go ungroomed or tear his garments.</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">11  He should not approach any dead person; he may not defile himself even for his father or his mother.</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">12  He should not go out from the sanctuary and should not profane the sanctuary of his God, for the sign of dedication, the anointing oil of his God, is upon him. I am Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">13  “‘He must take as a wife a woman who is a virgin.</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">14  He may not marry a widow, a divorced woman, one who has been defiled, or a prostitute; but he should take a virgin from his people as a wife.</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">15  He should not profane his offspring among his people, for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying him.’”</span>
<span id="p637" class="sentence">16  Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:</span>
<span id="p638" class="sentence">17  “Tell Aaron, ‘No man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to present the bread of his God.</span>
<span id="p639" class="sentence">18  If there is any man who has a defect, he may not approach: a man who is blind or lame or has a disfigured face or one limb too long,</span>
<span id="p640" class="sentence">19  a man with a fractured foot or a fractured hand,</span>
<span id="p641" class="sentence">20  a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man with an eye defect or eczema or ringworm or damaged testicles.</span>
<span id="p642" class="sentence">21  No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect may approach to present Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. Because he has a defect, he may not approach to present the bread of his God.</span>
<span id="p643" class="sentence">22  He may eat the bread of his God from the most holy things and from the holy things.</span>
<span id="p644" class="sentence">23  However, he may not come near the curtain, and he may not approach the altar, because there is a defect in him; and he should not profane my sanctuary, for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying them.’”</span>
<span id="p645" class="sentence">24  So Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites.</span></p></level1>
