<p><span id="p437" class="sentence">“You must sing a dirge concerning the chieftains of Israel</span>
<span id="p438" class="sentence">2  and say,‘What was your mother? A lioness among lions.
She lay down among strong young lions and reared her cubs.</span>
<span id="p439" class="sentence">3  She raised one of her cubs, and he became a strong young lion.
He learned how to tear prey apart,He even devoured humans.</span>
<span id="p440" class="sentence">4  Nations heard about him and caught him in their pit,And they brought him to the land of Egypt with hooks.</span>
<span id="p441" class="sentence">5  She waited and eventually saw that there was no hope for his return.
So she took another of her cubs and sent him out as a strong young lion.</span>
<span id="p442" class="sentence">6  He also walked about among the lions and became a strong young lion.
He learned how to tear prey apart, and he even devoured humans.</span>
<span id="p443" class="sentence">7  He prowled among their fortified towers and devastated their cities,So that the desolate land was filled with the sound of his roaring.</span>
<span id="p444" class="sentence">8  Nations from the surrounding districts came against him to cast their net over him,And he was caught in their pit.</span>
<span id="p445" class="sentence">9  With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon.
There they confined him, so that his voice would no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.</span>
<span id="p446" class="sentence">10  Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by waters.
It bore fruit and was full of branches because of the abundant water.</span>
<span id="p447" class="sentence">11  It developed strong branches, fit for the scepters of rulers.
It grew and towered over the other trees,And it became visible because of its height and because of the abundance of its foliage.</span>
<span id="p448" class="sentence">12  But in fury she was uprooted and thrown to the earth,And an east wind dried up her fruit.
Her strong branches were torn off and became dry, and fire consumed them.</span>
<span id="p449" class="sentence">13  Now she is planted in the wilderness,In a waterless, thirsty land.</span>
<span id="p450" class="sentence">14  The fire spread from her branches and consumed her shoots and her fruit,And there was no strong branch left, no scepter for ruling.
“‘That is a dirge, and it will serve as a dirge.’”</span></p></level1>
