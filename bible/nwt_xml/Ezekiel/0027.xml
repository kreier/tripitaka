<p><span id="p685" class="sentence">The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p686" class="sentence">2  “As for you, son of man, sing a dirge over Tyre,</span>
<span id="p687" class="sentence">3  and say to Tyre,‘You who dwell at the gateways of the sea,The merchant for the peoples of many islands,This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“O Tyre, you yourself have said, ‘I am perfect in beauty.’</span>
<span id="p688" class="sentence">4  Your territories are in the heart of the sea,And your builders have perfected your beauty.</span>
<span id="p689" class="sentence">5  They made all your planks from the juniper trees of Seʹnir,And they took a cedar from Lebʹa·non to make a mast for you.</span>
<span id="p690" class="sentence">6  They made your oars from oaks of Baʹshan,And your prow was of cypress inlaid with ivory from the islands of Kitʹtim.</span>
<span id="p691" class="sentence">7  Colorful linen from Egypt served as cloth for your sail,And your deck awnings were of blue thread and purple wool from the islands of E·liʹshah.</span>
<span id="p692" class="sentence">8  The inhabitants of Siʹdon and of Arʹvad were your rowers.
Your own skilled men, O Tyre, were your sailors.</span>
<span id="p693" class="sentence">9  The experienced and skilled men of Geʹbal caulked your seams.
All the ships of the sea and their mariners came to you to trade merchandise.</span>
<span id="p694" class="sentence">10  Men of Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, your men of war.
They hung their shields and helmets in you, and they brought you splendor.</span>
<span id="p695" class="sentence">11  The men of Arʹvad in your army were stationed on your walls all around,And brave men manned your towers.
They hung circular shields all around your wallsAnd perfected your beauty.</span>
<span id="p696" class="sentence">12  “‘“Tarʹshish did business with you because of your abundant wealth. They exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your goods.</span>
<span id="p697" class="sentence">13  Jaʹvan, Tuʹbal, and Meʹshech traded with you, exchanging slaves and articles of copper for your merchandise.</span>
<span id="p698" class="sentence">14  The house of To·garʹmah exchanged horses and steeds and mules for your goods.</span>
<span id="p699" class="sentence">15  The people of Deʹdan traded with you; you employed merchants on many islands; they gave ivory tusks and ebony as your tribute.</span>
<span id="p700" class="sentence">16  Eʹdom did business with you because of the abundance of your products. They gave turquoise, purple wool, colorful embroidery, fine fabric, corals, and rubies in exchange for your goods.</span>
<span id="p701" class="sentence">17  “‘“Judah and the land of Israel traded with you, giving the wheat of Minʹnith, choice foods, honey, oil, and balsam in exchange for your goods.</span>
<span id="p702" class="sentence">18  “‘“Damascus did business with you because of the abundance of your products and all your wealth, trading the wine of Helʹbon and wool of Zaʹhar.</span>
<span id="p703" class="sentence">19  Veʹdan and Jaʹvan from Uʹzal gave wrought iron, cassia, and cane in exchange for your goods.</span>
<span id="p704" class="sentence">20  Deʹdan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.</span>
<span id="p705" class="sentence">21  You employed the Arabs and all the chieftains of Keʹdar, who were merchants of lambs and rams and goats.</span>
<span id="p706" class="sentence">22  The merchants of Sheʹba and Raʹa·mah traded with you; they gave all sorts of the finest perfumes, precious stones, and gold in exchange for your goods.</span>
<span id="p707" class="sentence">23  Haʹran, Canʹneh, Eʹden, the merchants of Sheʹba, Asʹshur, and Chilʹmad traded with you.</span>
<span id="p708" class="sentence">24  In your marketplace they traded beautiful garments, cloaks made of blue material and colorful embroidery, and multicolored carpets, all bound and secured with ropes.</span>
<span id="p709" class="sentence">25  The ships of Tarʹshish were the caravans for your merchandise,So that you were filled and loaded down in the heart of the open sea.</span>
<span id="p710" class="sentence">26  Your rowers have brought you into heavy seas;The east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the open sea.</span>
<span id="p711" class="sentence">27  Your wealth, your goods, your merchandise, your mariners, and your sailors,Those caulking your seams, those trading your merchandise, and all the men of war—The entire multitude within you—They will all sink in the heart of the open sea on the day of your downfall.</span>
<span id="p712" class="sentence">28  When your sailors cry out, the coastlands will shudder.</span>
<span id="p713" class="sentence">29  All the oarsmen, the mariners, and the seamenWill come down from their ships and stand on the land.</span>
<span id="p714" class="sentence">30  They will raise their voices and cry out bitterly over youAs they throw dust on their heads and wallow in ashes.</span>
<span id="p715" class="sentence">31  They will make themselves bald and put on sackcloth;They will weep bitterly over you with intense wailing.</span>
<span id="p716" class="sentence">32  In their lamentation they will sing a dirge and chant over you:
‘Who is like Tyre, now silent in the midst of the sea?</span>
<span id="p717" class="sentence">33  When your goods came in from the open sea, you satisfied many peoples.
Your abundant wealth and your merchandise enriched earth’s kings.</span>
<span id="p718" class="sentence">34  Now you have been wrecked in the open sea, in the deep waters,And all your merchandise and your people have sunk with you.</span>
<span id="p719" class="sentence">35  All the inhabitants of the islands will stare at you in amazement,And their kings will shudder with horror—their faces will be troubled.</span>
<span id="p720" class="sentence">36  The merchants among the nations will whistle over what happened to you.
Your end will be sudden and terrible,And you will cease to exist for all time.’”’”</span></p></level1>
