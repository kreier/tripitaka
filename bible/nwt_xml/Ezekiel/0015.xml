<p><span id="p306" class="sentence">The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">2  “Son of man, how does the wood of the vine compare with that of any other tree or branch from the trees of the forest?</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">3  Can a pole from it be used to do work? Or do people make a peg from it to hang utensils on?</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">4  Look! It is thrown into the fire for fuel, and the fire consumes both ends and scorches the middle. Is it now fit for any work?</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">5  Even when it was whole, it could not be used for anything. How much less useful it will be when the fire has consumed and scorched it!”</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">6  “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Just like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given as fuel for the fire, so I will deal with the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">7  I have set my face against them. They have escaped from the fire, but fire will consume them. And you will have to know that I am Jehovah when I set my face against them.’”</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">8  “‘And I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span></p></level1>
