<p><span id="p722" class="sentence">The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p723" class="sentence">2  “Son of man, tell the leader of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“Because your heart has become haughty, you keep saying, ‘I am a god.
I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the sea.’
But you are only a man, not a god,Though in your heart you feel that you are a god.</span>
<span id="p724" class="sentence">3  Look! You are wiser than Daniel.
No secrets have been hidden from you.</span>
<span id="p725" class="sentence">4  You have made yourself wealthy by your wisdom and your discernment,And you keep storing up gold and silver in your treasuries.</span>
<span id="p726" class="sentence">5  Your skillful trading brought you great wealth,And your heart grew haughty because of your wealth.”’</span>
<span id="p727" class="sentence">6  “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“Because in your heart you feel that you are a god,</span>
<span id="p728" class="sentence">7  I am bringing foreigners against you, the most ruthless of the nations,And they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdomAnd defile your glorious splendor.</span>
<span id="p729" class="sentence">8  They will bring you down to the pit,And you will die a violent death in the heart of the open sea.</span>
<span id="p730" class="sentence">9  Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ to the one killing you?
You will be a mere man, not a god, in the hand of those defiling you.”’</span>
<span id="p731" class="sentence">10  ‘By the hand of foreigners, you will die the death of the uncircumcised ones,For I myself have spoken,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p732" class="sentence">11  And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p733" class="sentence">12  “Son of man, sing a dirge concerning the king of Tyre, and tell him, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“You were the model of perfection,Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.</span>
<span id="p734" class="sentence">13  You were in Eʹden, the garden of God.
You were adorned with every precious stone—Ruby, topaz, and jasper; chrysʹo·lite, onyx, and jade; sapphire, turquoise, and emerald;And their settings and mountings were made of gold.
They were prepared on the day you were created.</span>
<span id="p735" class="sentence">14  I assigned you as the anointed covering cherub.
You were on the holy mountain of God, and you walked about among fiery stones.</span>
<span id="p736" class="sentence">15  You were faultless in your ways from the day you were createdUntil unrighteousness was found in you.</span>
<span id="p737" class="sentence">16  Because of your abundant trade,You became filled with violence, and you began to sin.
So I will cast you out as profane from the mountain of God and destroy you,O covering cherub, away from the stones of fire.</span>
<span id="p738" class="sentence">17  Your heart became haughty because of your beauty.
You corrupted your wisdom because of your own glorious splendor.
I will throw you down to the earth.
I will make you a spectacle before kings.</span>
<span id="p739" class="sentence">18  Because of your great guilt and your dishonest trading, you have profaned your sanctuaries.
I will cause a fire to break out in your midst, and it will consume you.
I will reduce you to ashes on the earth before all those looking at you.</span>
<span id="p740" class="sentence">19  All who knew you among the peoples will stare at you in amazement.
Your end will be sudden and terrible,And you will cease to exist for all time.”’”</span>
<span id="p741" class="sentence">20  And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p742" class="sentence">21  “Son of man, turn your face toward Siʹdon, and prophesy against her.</span>
<span id="p743" class="sentence">22  You should say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
“Here I am against you, O Siʹdon, and I will be glorified in your midst;And people will have to know that I am Jehovah when I execute judgment on her and I am sanctified in her.</span>
<span id="p744" class="sentence">23  I will send pestilence into her and blood will flow in her streets.
The slain will fall in her midst when the sword comes against her from all sides;And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p745" class="sentence">24  “‘“Then the house of Israel will no longer be surrounded by injurious briars and painful thorns, those who treat them with scorn; and people will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”’</span>
<span id="p746" class="sentence">25  “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “When I regather the house of Israel from among the peoples where they were scattered, I will be sanctified among them in the eyes of the nations. And they will dwell on their land that I gave to my servant Jacob.</span>
<span id="p747" class="sentence">26  They will dwell on it in security and build houses and plant vineyards, and they will dwell in security when I execute judgment on all those around them who treat them with scorn; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah their God.”’”</span></p></level1>
