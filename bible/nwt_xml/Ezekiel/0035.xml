<p><span id="p916" class="sentence">The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:</span>
<span id="p917" class="sentence">2  “Son of man, turn your face toward the mountainous region of Seʹir, and prophesy against it.</span>
<span id="p918" class="sentence">3  Say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Here I am against you, O mountainous region of Seʹir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate wasteland.</span>
<span id="p919" class="sentence">4  I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolate wasteland; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p920" class="sentence">5  For you showed unrelenting hostility, and you gave the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of their final punishment.”’</span>
<span id="p921" class="sentence">6  “‘Therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since it was blood that you hated, bloodshed will pursue you.</span>
<span id="p922" class="sentence">7  I will make the mountainous region of Seʹir a desolate wasteland, and I will cut off from it anyone passing through and anyone returning.</span>
<span id="p923" class="sentence">8  I will fill its mountains with the slain; and those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your streams.</span>
<span id="p924" class="sentence">9  I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’</span>
<span id="p925" class="sentence">10  “Because you said, ‘These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will take possession of both,’ even though Jehovah himself was there,</span>
<span id="p926" class="sentence">11  ‘therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘I will deal with you according to the same anger and jealousy that you displayed in your hatred toward them; and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.</span>
<span id="p927" class="sentence">12  You will then have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have heard all the insolent things you spoke against the mountains of Israel when you said, “They have been laid desolate and have been given to us to devour.”</span>
<span id="p928" class="sentence">13  And you spoke arrogantly against me, and you multiplied your words against me. I heard it all.’</span>
<span id="p929" class="sentence">14  “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘The whole earth will rejoice when I will make you a desolate wasteland.</span>
<span id="p930" class="sentence">15  Just as you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel was laid desolate, that is how I will deal with you. You will become a desolate ruin, O mountainous region of Seʹir, yes, all of Eʹdom; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”</span></p></level1>
