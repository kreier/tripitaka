<p><span id="p1110" class="sentence">Bezʹal·el then made the Ark of acacia wood. It was two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high.</span>
<span id="p1111" class="sentence">2  He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and made a border of gold around it.</span>
<span id="p1112" class="sentence">3  After that he cast four rings of gold for it, for above its four feet, with two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side.</span>
<span id="p1113" class="sentence">4  He next made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</span>
<span id="p1114" class="sentence">5  Then he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the Ark for carrying the Ark.</span>
<span id="p1115" class="sentence">6  He made the cover of pure gold. It was two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.</span>
<span id="p1116" class="sentence">7  He then made two cherubs of hammered gold on both ends of the cover.</span>
<span id="p1117" class="sentence">8  One cherub was on one end, and the other cherub on the other end. He made the cherubs on both ends of the cover.</span>
<span id="p1118" class="sentence">9  The two cherubs spread out their wings upward, overshadowing the cover with their wings. They were facing each other, and their faces were turned toward the cover.</span>
<span id="p1119" class="sentence">10  He then made the table of acacia wood. It was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.</span>
<span id="p1120" class="sentence">11  And he overlaid it with pure gold and made a border of gold around it.</span>
<span id="p1121" class="sentence">12  Next he made a rim the width of a handbreadth to go around it and a border of gold to go around the rim.</span>
<span id="p1122" class="sentence">13  Further, he cast four rings of gold for it and placed the rings on the four corners where the four legs were attached.</span>
<span id="p1123" class="sentence">14  The rings were near the rim, as holders for the poles used for carrying the table.</span>
<span id="p1124" class="sentence">15  Then he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold for carrying the table.</span>
<span id="p1125" class="sentence">16  After that he made out of pure gold the utensils that went on the table—its dishes, its cups, and its bowls and pitchers from which drink offerings would be poured.</span>
<span id="p1126" class="sentence">17  Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work. Its base, its stem, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms were one piece.</span>
<span id="p1127" class="sentence">18  Six branches were extending out from its stem, three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches from its other side.</span>
<span id="p1128" class="sentence">19  Three cups shaped like almond flowers were on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like almond flowers were on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. This was done for the six branches extending out from the stem of the lampstand.</span>
<span id="p1129" class="sentence">20  And on the stem of the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers, with knobs and blossoms alternating.</span>
<span id="p1130" class="sentence">21  There was a knob under the first two branches that extended out of the stem and a knob under the next two branches and a knob under the next two branches, for the six branches extending out from the stem of the lampstand.</span>
<span id="p1131" class="sentence">22  The knobs and the branches and the whole lampstand were made to be one piece of pure, hammered gold.</span>
<span id="p1132" class="sentence">23  Then he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its fire holders out of pure gold.</span>
<span id="p1133" class="sentence">24  He made it, along with all its utensils, from a talent of pure gold.</span>
<span id="p1134" class="sentence">25  He now made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns were one piece with it.</span>
<span id="p1135" class="sentence">26  He overlaid it with pure gold, its top surface and its sides all around and its horns, and he made a border of gold around it.</span>
<span id="p1136" class="sentence">27  He made two rings of gold for it below its border on two opposite sides to hold the poles used for carrying it.</span>
<span id="p1137" class="sentence">28  After that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</span>
<span id="p1138" class="sentence">29  He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, perfumed incense, skillfully blended.</span></p></level1>
