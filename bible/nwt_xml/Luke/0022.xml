<level1><h1 id="p993">Chapter 22</h1>
<p><span id="p994" class="sentence">Now the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover, was getting near.</span>
<span id="p995" class="sentence">2  And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for an effective way to get rid of him, because they were afraid of the people.</span>
<span id="p996" class="sentence">3  Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Is·carʹi·ot, who was numbered among the Twelve,</span>
<span id="p997" class="sentence">4  and he went off and talked with the chief priests and temple captains about how to betray him to them.</span>
<span id="p998" class="sentence">5  They were delighted at this and agreed to give him silver money.</span>
<span id="p999" class="sentence">6  So he consented and began looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around.</span>
<span id="p1000" class="sentence">7  The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived, on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered;</span>
<span id="p1001" class="sentence">8  so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.”</span>
<span id="p1002" class="sentence">9  They said to him: “Where do you want us to get it ready?”</span>
<span id="p1003" class="sentence">10  He said to them: “Look! When you enter into the city, a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters.</span>
<span id="p1004" class="sentence">11  And say to the landlord of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you: “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’</span>
<span id="p1005" class="sentence">12  And that man will show you a large, furnished upper room. Get it ready there.”</span>
<span id="p1006" class="sentence">13  So they left and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.</span>
<span id="p1007" class="sentence">14  So when the hour came, he reclined at the table along with the apostles.</span>
<span id="p1008" class="sentence">15  And he said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</span>
<span id="p1009" class="sentence">16  for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<span id="p1010" class="sentence">17  And accepting a cup, he gave thanks and said: “Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves,</span>
<span id="p1011" class="sentence">18  for I tell you, from now on, I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.”</span>
<span id="p1012" class="sentence">19  Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”</span>
<span id="p1013" class="sentence">20  Also, he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.</span>
<span id="p1014" class="sentence">21  “But look! the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table.</span>
<span id="p1015" class="sentence">22  For, indeed, the Son of man is going his way according to what has been determined; all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span>
<span id="p1016" class="sentence">23  So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this.</span>
<span id="p1017" class="sentence">24  However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest.</span>
<span id="p1018" class="sentence">25  But he said to them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors.</span>
<span id="p1019" class="sentence">26  You, though, are not to be that way. But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the one taking the lead as the one ministering.</span>
<span id="p1020" class="sentence">27  For which one is greater, the one dining or the one serving? Is it not the one dining? But I am among you as the one serving.</span>
<span id="p1021" class="sentence">28  “However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials;</span>
<span id="p1022" class="sentence">29  and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom,</span>
<span id="p1023" class="sentence">30  so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of Israel.</span>
<span id="p1024" class="sentence">31  “Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat.</span>
<span id="p1025" class="sentence">32  But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”</span>
<span id="p1026" class="sentence">33  Then he said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.”</span>
<span id="p1027" class="sentence">34  But he said: “I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.”</span>
<span id="p1028" class="sentence">35  He also said to them: “When I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” They said: “No!”</span>
<span id="p1029" class="sentence">36  Then he said to them: “But now let the one who has a money bag take it, likewise a food pouch, and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.</span>
<span id="p1030" class="sentence">37  For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me, namely, ‘He was counted with lawless ones.’ For this is being fulfilled concerning me.”</span>
<span id="p1031" class="sentence">38  Then they said: “Lord, look! here are two swords.” He said to them: “It is enough.”</span>
<span id="p1032" class="sentence">39  On leaving, he went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</span>
<span id="p1033" class="sentence">40  On arriving at the place, he said to them: “Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation.”</span>
<span id="p1034" class="sentence">41  And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw away, and he bent his knees and began to pray,</span>
<span id="p1035" class="sentence">42  saying: “Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”</span>
<span id="p1036" class="sentence">43  Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</span>
<span id="p1037" class="sentence">44  But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.</span>
<span id="p1038" class="sentence">45  When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples, he found them slumbering, exhausted from grief.</span>
<span id="p1039" class="sentence">46  He said to them: “Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep praying, so that you do not enter into temptation.”</span>
<span id="p1040" class="sentence">47  While he was still speaking, look! a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them, and he approached Jesus to kiss him.</span>
<span id="p1041" class="sentence">48  But Jesus said to him: “Judas, are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss?”</span>
<span id="p1042" class="sentence">49  When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, should we strike with the sword?”</span>
<span id="p1043" class="sentence">50  One of them even struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his right ear.</span>
<span id="p1044" class="sentence">51  But in reply Jesus said: “That is enough.” And he touched the ear and healed him.</span>
<span id="p1045" class="sentence">52  Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come there for him: “Did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?</span>
<span id="p1046" class="sentence">53  While I was with you in the temple day after day, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.”</span>
<span id="p1047" class="sentence">54  Then they arrested him and led him off, and they brought him into the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.</span>
<span id="p1048" class="sentence">55  When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.</span>
<span id="p1049" class="sentence">56  But a servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light of the fire, looked closely at him and said: “This man was also with him.”</span>
<span id="p1050" class="sentence">57  But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him, woman.”</span>
<span id="p1051" class="sentence">58  After a short time another person saw him and said: “You too are one of them.” But Peter said: “Man, I am not.”</span>
<span id="p1052" class="sentence">59  And after about an hour had passed, another man began insisting strongly: “Certainly this man was also with him, for he is, in fact, a Gal·i·leʹan!”</span>
<span id="p1053" class="sentence">60  But Peter said: “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</span>
<span id="p1054" class="sentence">61  At this the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter recalled the statement of the Lord when he had said to him: “Before a rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”</span>
<span id="p1055" class="sentence">62  And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span>
<span id="p1056" class="sentence">63  Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock him, hitting him;</span>
<span id="p1057" class="sentence">64  and after covering his face, they kept asking: “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”</span>
<span id="p1058" class="sentence">65  And they said many other blasphemous things against him.</span>
<span id="p1059" class="sentence">66  And when it became day, the assembly of elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they led him into their Sanʹhe·drin hall and said:</span>
<span id="p1060" class="sentence">67  “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them: “Even if I told you, you would not believe it at all.</span>
<span id="p1061" class="sentence">68  Moreover, if I questioned you, you would not answer.</span>
<span id="p1062" class="sentence">69  However, from now on the Son of man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God.”</span>
<span id="p1063" class="sentence">70  At this they all said: “Are you, therefore, the Son of God?” He said to them: “You yourselves are saying that I am.”</span>
<span id="p1064" class="sentence">71  They said: “Why do we need further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it out of his own mouth.”</span></p></level1>
