<level1><h1 id="p1065">Chapter 23</h1>
<p><span id="p1066" class="sentence">So the multitude got up, one and all, and led him to Pilate.</span>
<span id="p1067" class="sentence">2  Then they began to accuse him, saying: “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar, and saying he himself is Christ a king.”</span>
<span id="p1068" class="sentence">3  Now Pilate asked him the question: “Are you the King of the Jews?” In answer he said: “You yourself are saying it.”</span>
<span id="p1069" class="sentence">4  Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: “I find no crime in this man.”</span>
<span id="p1070" class="sentence">5  But they insisted, saying: “He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Ju·deʹa, starting from Galʹi·lee even to here.”</span>
<span id="p1071" class="sentence">6  On hearing that, Pilate asked whether the man was a Gal·i·leʹan.</span>
<span id="p1072" class="sentence">7  After ascertaining that he was under the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him on to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</span>
<span id="p1073" class="sentence">8  When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly. For a considerable time he had been wanting to see Jesus because he had heard much about him, and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him.</span>
<span id="p1074" class="sentence">9  So he began to question him at length, but he gave him no answer.</span>
<span id="p1075" class="sentence">10  However, the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him.</span>
<span id="p1076" class="sentence">11  Then Herod together with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and he mocked him by clothing him with a splendid garment and then sent him back to Pilate.</span>
<span id="p1077" class="sentence">12  Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that very day, for before that they had been at enmity with each other.</span>
<span id="p1078" class="sentence">13  Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people</span>
<span id="p1079" class="sentence">14  and said to them: “You brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt. Now look! I examined him in front of you but found in this man no grounds for the charges you are bringing against him.</span>
<span id="p1080" class="sentence">15  In fact, neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us, and look! he has done nothing deserving of death.</span>
<span id="p1081" class="sentence">16  I will therefore punish him and release him.”</span>
<span id="p1082" class="sentence">17  ——</span>
<span id="p1083" class="sentence">18  But the whole crowd shouted out: “Do away with this man, and release Bar·abʹbas to us!”</span>
<span id="p1084" class="sentence">19  (This man had been thrown into prison for sedition that had occurred in the city and for murder.)</span>
<span id="p1085" class="sentence">20  Again Pilate called out to them, because he wanted to release Jesus.</span>
<span id="p1086" class="sentence">21  Then they began to yell, saying: “To the stake with him! To the stake with him!”</span>
<span id="p1087" class="sentence">22  The third time he said to them: “Why? What bad thing did this man do? I found in him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore punish him and release him.”</span>
<span id="p1088" class="sentence">23  At this they became insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be executed, and their voices prevailed.</span>
<span id="p1089" class="sentence">24  So Pilate made the decision that their demand be met.</span>
<span id="p1090" class="sentence">25  He released the man whom they were demanding, who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, but he surrendered Jesus to their will.</span>
<span id="p1091" class="sentence">26  Now as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cy·reʹne, who was coming from the countryside, and they placed the torture stake on him to carry it behind Jesus.</span>
<span id="p1092" class="sentence">27  A large number of people were following him, including women who kept beating themselves in grief and wailing for him.</span>
<span id="p1093" class="sentence">28  Jesus turned to the women and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for me. Weep instead for yourselves and for your children;</span>
<span id="p1094" class="sentence">29  for look! days are coming when people will say, ‘Happy are the barren women, the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse!’</span>
<span id="p1095" class="sentence">30  Then they will start saying to the mountains, ‘Fall over us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us over!’</span>
<span id="p1096" class="sentence">31  If they do these things when the tree is moist, what will occur when it is withered?”</span>
<span id="p1097" class="sentence">32  Two other men, criminals, were also being led off to be executed with him.</span>
<span id="p1098" class="sentence">33  And when they got to the place called Skull, they nailed him to the stake there alongside the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</span>
<span id="p1099" class="sentence">34  But Jesus was saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Furthermore, they cast lots to distribute his garments.</span>
<span id="p1100" class="sentence">35  And the people stood looking on. But the rulers were sneering and saying: “Others he saved; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”</span>
<span id="p1101" class="sentence">36  Even the soldiers mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine</span>
<span id="p1102" class="sentence">37  and saying: “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.”</span>
<span id="p1103" class="sentence">38  There was also an inscription over him: “This is the King of the Jews.”</span>
<span id="p1104" class="sentence">39  Then one of the criminals hanging there began to speak abusively to him, saying: “You are the Christ, are you not? Save yourself and us too!”</span>
<span id="p1105" class="sentence">40  In response the other rebuked him, saying: “Do you not fear God at all, now that you have received the same judgment?</span>
<span id="p1106" class="sentence">41  And we rightly so, for we are getting back what we deserve for the things we did; but this man did nothing wrong.”</span>
<span id="p1107" class="sentence">42  Then he said: “Jesus, remember me when you get into your Kingdom.”</span>
<span id="p1108" class="sentence">43  And he said to him: “Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.”</span>
<span id="p1109" class="sentence">44  Well, by now it was about the sixth hour, and yet a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour,</span>
<span id="p1110" class="sentence">45  because the sunlight failed; then the curtain of the sanctuary was torn down the middle.</span>
<span id="p1111" class="sentence">46  And Jesus called out with a loud voice and said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he expired.</span>
<span id="p1112" class="sentence">47  Because of seeing what occurred, the army officer began to glorify God, saying: “Truly, this man was righteous.”</span>
<span id="p1113" class="sentence">48  And when all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle saw the things that occurred, they returned home, beating their chests.</span>
<span id="p1114" class="sentence">49  And all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance. Also, women who had accompanied him from Galʹi·lee were there and saw these things.</span>
<span id="p1115" class="sentence">50  And look! there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, who was a good and righteous man.</span>
<span id="p1116" class="sentence">51  (This man had not voted in support of their scheme and action.) He was from Ar·i·ma·theʹa, a city of the Ju·deʹans, and was waiting for the Kingdom of God.</span>
<span id="p1117" class="sentence">52  This man went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span>
<span id="p1118" class="sentence">53  And he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen, and he laid it in a tomb carved in the rock, where no man had yet lain.</span>
<span id="p1119" class="sentence">54  Now it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</span>
<span id="p1120" class="sentence">55  But the women who had come with him from Galʹi·lee followed along and took a look at the tomb and saw how his body was laid,</span>
<span id="p1121" class="sentence">56  and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils. But, of course, they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.</span></p></level1>
