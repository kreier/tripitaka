<p><span id="p136" class="sentence">In the 15th year of the reign of Ti·beʹri·us Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Ju·deʹa, Herod was district ruler of Galʹi·lee, Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of It·u·raeʹa and Trach·o·niʹtis, and Ly·saʹni·as was district ruler of Ab·i·leʹne,</span>
<span id="p137" class="sentence">2  in the days of chief priest Anʹnas and of Caʹia·phas, God’s declaration came to John the son of Zech·a·riʹah in the wilderness.</span>
<span id="p138" class="sentence">3  So he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins,</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">4  just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">5  Every valley must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled; the crooked ways must become straight, and the rough ways smooth;</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">6  and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’”</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">7  So he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: “You offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">8  Therefore, produce fruits that befit repentance. Do not start saying to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">9  Indeed, the ax is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">10  And the crowds were asking him: “What, then, should we do?”</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">11  In reply he said to them: “Let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none, and let the one who has something to eat do the same.”</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">12  Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what should we do?”</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">13  He said to them: “Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.”</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">14  Also, those in military service were asking him: “What should we do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely, but be satisfied with your provisions.”</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">15  Now the people were in expectation and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John, “May he perhaps be the Christ?”</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">16  John gave the answer, saying to all: “I, for my part, baptize you with water, but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire.</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">17  His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">18  He also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people.</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">19  But Herod the district ruler, because of being reproved by John concerning He·roʹdi·as the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod had done,</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">20  added this also to all those deeds: He locked John up in prison.</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">21  Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus too was baptized. As he was praying, the heaven was opened up,</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">22  and the holy spirit in bodily form like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.”</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">23  When Jesus began his work, he was about 30 years old, being the son, as the opinion was,of Joseph,son of Heʹli,</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">24  son of Matʹthat,son of Leʹvi,son of Melʹchi,son of Janʹna·i,son of Joseph,</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">25  son of Mat·ta·thiʹas,son of Aʹmos,son of Naʹhum,son of Esʹli,son of Nagʹga·i,</span>
<span id="p161" class="sentence">26  son of Maʹath,son of Mat·ta·thiʹas,son of Semʹe·in,son of Joʹsech,son of Joʹda,</span>
<span id="p162" class="sentence">27  son of Jo·anʹan,son of Rheʹsa,son of Ze·rubʹba·bel,son of She·alʹti·el,son of Neʹri,</span>
<span id="p163" class="sentence">28  son of Melʹchi,son of Adʹdi,son of Coʹsam,son of El·maʹdam,son of Er,</span>
<span id="p164" class="sentence">29  son of Jesus,son of E·li·eʹzer,son of Joʹrim,son of Matʹthat,son of Leʹvi,</span>

<span id="p170" class="sentence">35  son of Seʹrug,son of Reʹu,son of Peʹleg,son of Eʹber,son of Sheʹlah,</span>
<span id="p171" class="sentence">36  son of Ca·iʹnan,son of Ar·pachʹshad,son of Shem,son of Noah,son of Laʹmech,</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">37  son of Me·thuʹse·lah,son of Eʹnoch,son of Jaʹred,son of Ma·haʹla·le·el,son of Ca·iʹnan,</span>
