<level1><h1 id="p857">Chapter 19</h1>
<p><span id="p858" class="sentence">He then entered Jerʹi·cho and was passing through.</span>
<span id="p859" class="sentence">2  Now a man named Zac·chaeʹus was there; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</span>
<span id="p860" class="sentence">3  Well, he was trying to see who this Jesus was, but he could not see because of the crowd, since he was short.</span>
<span id="p861" class="sentence">4  So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see him, for he was about to pass that way.</span>
<span id="p862" class="sentence">5  Now when Jesus got to the place, he looked up and said to him: “Zac·chaeʹus, hurry and get down, for today I must stay in your house.”</span>
<span id="p863" class="sentence">6  With that he hurried down and joyfully welcomed him as a guest.</span>
<span id="p864" class="sentence">7  When they saw this, they were all muttering: “He went as a guest to the house of a man who is a sinner.”</span>
<span id="p865" class="sentence">8  But Zac·chaeʹus stood up and said to the Lord: “Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted from anyone, I am restoring four times over.”</span>
<span id="p866" class="sentence">9  At this Jesus said to him: “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.</span>
<span id="p867" class="sentence">10  For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.”</span>
<span id="p868" class="sentence">11  While they were listening to these things, he told another illustration, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the Kingdom of God was going to appear instantly.</span>
<span id="p869" class="sentence">12  So he said: “A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return.</span>
<span id="p870" class="sentence">13  Calling ten of his slaves, he gave them ten miʹnas and told them, ‘Do business with these until I come.’</span>
<span id="p871" class="sentence">14  But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to become king over us.’</span>
<span id="p872" class="sentence">15  “When he eventually got back after having secured the kingly power, he summoned the slaves to whom he had given the money, in order to ascertain what they had gained by their business activity.</span>
<span id="p873" class="sentence">16  So the first one came forward and said, ‘Lord, your miʹna gained ten miʹnas.’</span>
<span id="p874" class="sentence">17  He said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities.’</span>
<span id="p875" class="sentence">18  Now the second came, saying, ‘Your miʹna, Lord, made five miʹnas.’</span>
<span id="p876" class="sentence">19  He said to this one as well, ‘You too be in charge of five cities.’</span>
<span id="p877" class="sentence">20  But another one came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your miʹna that I kept hidden away in a cloth.</span>
<span id="p878" class="sentence">21  You see, I was in fear of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.’</span>
<span id="p879" class="sentence">22  He said to him, ‘By your own words I judge you, wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I am a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?</span>
<span id="p880" class="sentence">23  So why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my coming, I would have collected it with interest.’</span>
<span id="p881" class="sentence">24  “With that he said to those standing by, ‘Take the miʹna from him and give it to the one who has the ten miʹnas.’</span>
<span id="p882" class="sentence">25  But they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten miʹnas!’—</span>
<span id="p883" class="sentence">26  ‘I say to you, to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</span>
<span id="p884" class="sentence">27  Moreover, bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me.’”</span>
<span id="p885" class="sentence">28  After he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p886" class="sentence">29  And when he got near to Bethʹpha·ge and Bethʹa·ny at the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</span>
<span id="p887" class="sentence">30  saying: “Go into the village that is within sight, and after you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.</span>
<span id="p888" class="sentence">31  But if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you must say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”</span>
<span id="p889" class="sentence">32  So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had said to them.</span>
<span id="p890" class="sentence">33  But as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them: “Why are you untying the colt?”</span>
<span id="p891" class="sentence">34  They said: “The Lord needs it.”</span>
<span id="p892" class="sentence">35  And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their outer garments on the colt and seated Jesus on it.</span>
<span id="p893" class="sentence">36  As he moved along, they were spreading their outer garments on the road.</span>
<span id="p894" class="sentence">37  As soon as he got near the road down the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the powerful works they had seen,</span>
<span id="p895" class="sentence">38  saying: “Blessed is the one coming as the King in Jehovah’s name! Peace in heaven, and glory in the heights above!”</span>
<span id="p896" class="sentence">39  However, some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”</span>
<span id="p897" class="sentence">40  But in reply he said: “I tell you, if these remained silent, the stones would cry out.”</span>
<span id="p898" class="sentence">41  And when he got nearby, he viewed the city and wept over it,</span>
<span id="p899" class="sentence">42  saying: “If you, even you, had discerned on this day the things having to do with peace—but now they have been hidden from your eyes.</span>
<span id="p900" class="sentence">43  Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege you from every side.</span>
<span id="p901" class="sentence">44  They will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.”</span>
<span id="p902" class="sentence">45  Then he entered the temple and started to throw out those who were selling,</span>
<span id="p903" class="sentence">46  saying to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers.”</span>
<span id="p904" class="sentence">47  He continued teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to kill him;</span>
<span id="p905" class="sentence">48  but they did not find any way to do this, for the people one and all kept hanging on to him to hear him.</span></p></level1>
