<span id="p371" class="sentence">31  Then I brought the princes of Judah up on top of the wall. Further, I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions, and the one walked to the right on the wall toward the Gate of the Ash Heaps.</span>

<span id="p380" class="sentence">40  At length the two thanksgiving choirs stood before the house of the true God; so did I and half of the deputy rulers with me,</span>
<span id="p381" class="sentence">41  and the priests E·liʹa·kim, Ma·a·seiʹah, Mi·niʹa·min, Mi·caiʹah, Eli·o·eʹnai, Zech·a·riʹah, and Han·a·niʹah, with the trumpets,</span>

<span id="p383" class="sentence">43  On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for the true God made them rejoice with great joy. The women and the children also rejoiced, so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away.</span>
<span id="p384" class="sentence">44  On that day men were appointed over the storehouses for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tenths. Into them they were to gather from the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for there was rejoicing in Judah because of the priests and the Levites who were ministering.</span>
<span id="p385" class="sentence">45  And they began taking care of the duties of their God and the obligation of the purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the instructions of David and his son Solʹo·mon.</span>
<span id="p386" class="sentence">46  For long ago in the days of David and Aʹsaph, there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.</span>
<span id="p387" class="sentence">47  And during the days of Ze·rubʹba·bel and during the days of Ne·he·miʹah, all Israel gave portions to the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the daily need. They also set aside the portion for the Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.</span></p></level1>
