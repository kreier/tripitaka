<p><span id="p132" class="sentence">As soon as the wall had been rebuilt I set up the doors; then the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed.</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">2  I then put my brother Ha·naʹni in charge of Jerusalem, along with Han·a·niʹah the chief of the Fortress, for he was a most trustworthy man and feared the true God more than many others.</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">3  So I said to them: “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the heat of the day, and while they are standing guard, they should shut the doors and bolt them.
