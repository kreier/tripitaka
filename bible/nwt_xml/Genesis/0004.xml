<level1><h1 id="p84">Chapter 4</h1>
<p><span id="p85" class="sentence">Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">2  Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel.
Abel became a shepherd of the flock, but Cain became a cultivator of the ground.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">3  After some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">4  But Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat. While Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering,</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">5  he did not look with any favor on Cain and on his offering. So Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">6  Then Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you so angry and dejected?</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">7  If you turn to doing good, will you not be restored to favor? But if you do not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door, and its craving is to dominate you; but will you get the mastery over it?”</span>
<span id="p92" class="sentence">8  After that Cain said to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.” So while they were in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him.</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">9  Later on, Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?”</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">10  At this He said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">11  And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">12  When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its produce. You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth.”</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">13  At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The punishment for my error is too great to bear.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">14  Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me.”</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">15  So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times.”
So Jehovah set up a sign for Cain in order that no one finding him would strike him.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">16  Then Cain went away from before Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Exile, to the east of Eʹden.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">17  Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Eʹnoch. Then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son Eʹnoch.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">18  Later Iʹrad was born to Eʹnoch. And Iʹrad became father to Me·huʹja·el, and Me·huʹja·el became father to Me·thuʹsha·el, and Me·thuʹsha·el became father to Laʹmech.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">19  Laʹmech took two wives for himself. The name of the first was Aʹdah, and the name of the second was Zilʹlah.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">20  Aʹdah gave birth to Jaʹbal. He was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">21  His brother’s name was Juʹbal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">22  Also, Zilʹlah gave birth to Tuʹbal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tuʹbal-cain was Naʹa·mah.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">23  Then Laʹmech composed these words for his wives Aʹdah and Zilʹlah:
“Hear my voice, you wives of Laʹmech;Give ear to my saying:
A man I have killed for wounding me,Yes, a young man for striking me.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">24  If 7 times Cain is to be avenged,Then Laʹmech 77 times.”</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">25  Adam again had sexual relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth because, as she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.”</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">26  There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Eʹnosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
