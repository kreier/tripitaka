<level1><h1 id="p684">Chapter 25</h1>
<p><span id="p685" class="sentence">Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Ke·tuʹrah.</span>
<span id="p686" class="sentence">2  In time she bore him Zimʹran, Jokʹshan, Meʹdan, Midʹi·an, Ishʹbak, and Shuʹah.</span>
<span id="p687" class="sentence">3  Jokʹshan became father to Sheʹba and Deʹdan.
The sons of Deʹdan were As·shuʹrim, Le·tuʹshim, and Le·umʹmim.</span>
<span id="p688" class="sentence">4  The sons of Midʹi·an were Eʹphah, Eʹpher, Haʹnoch, A·biʹda, and El·daʹah.
All of these were the sons of Ke·tuʹrah.</span>
<span id="p689" class="sentence">5  Later on Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac,</span>
<span id="p690" class="sentence">6  but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines. Then while he was still alive, he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the land of the East.</span>
<span id="p691" class="sentence">7  The years of Abraham’s life were 175 years.</span>
<span id="p692" class="sentence">8  Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old and satisfied, and was gathered to his people.</span>
<span id="p693" class="sentence">9  His sons Isaac and Ishʹma·el buried him in the cave of Mach·peʹlah in the field of Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar the Hitʹtite that is in front of Mamʹre,</span>
<span id="p694" class="sentence">10  the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah.</span>
<span id="p695" class="sentence">11  After Abraham’s death, God continued to bless his son Isaac, and Isaac was dwelling near Beʹer-laʹhai-roi.</span>
<span id="p696" class="sentence">12  This is the history of Ishʹma·el the son of Abraham whom Haʹgar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah, bore to Abraham.</span>
<span id="p697" class="sentence">13  Now these are the names of the sons of Ishʹma·el, by their names according to their family origins: Ishʹma·el’s firstborn Ne·baʹioth, then Keʹdar, Adʹbe·el, Mibʹsam,</span>
<span id="p698" class="sentence">14  Mishʹma, Duʹmah, Masʹsa,</span>
<span id="p699" class="sentence">15  Haʹdad, Teʹma, Jeʹtur, Naʹphish, and Kedʹe·mah.</span>
<span id="p700" class="sentence">16  These are the sons of Ishʹma·el, and these are their names by their settlements and by their encampments, 12 chieftains according to their clans.</span>
<span id="p701" class="sentence">17  And Ishʹma·el lived for 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people.</span>
<span id="p702" class="sentence">18  And they took up dwelling from Havʹi·lah near Shur, which is close to Egypt, as far as As·syrʹi·a. He settled near all his brothers.</span>
<span id="p703" class="sentence">19  And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham.
Abraham became father to Isaac.</span>
<span id="p704" class="sentence">20  Isaac was 40 years old when he married Re·bekʹah, the daughter of Be·thuʹel the A·ra·maeʹan of Padʹdan-aʹram, the sister of Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan.</span>
<span id="p705" class="sentence">21  And Isaac kept pleading with Jehovah regarding his wife, because she was barren; so Jehovah responded to his plea, and his wife Re·bekʹah became pregnant.</span>
<span id="p706" class="sentence">22  And the sons within her began to struggle with each other, so that she said: “If this is the way it is, why should I go on living?” So she inquired of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p707" class="sentence">23  And Jehovah said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from within you; and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation, and the older will serve the younger.”</span>
<span id="p708" class="sentence">24  When the time came for her to give birth, look! twins were in her womb.</span>
<span id="p709" class="sentence">25  Then the first came out red all over and was like a garment of hair, so they named him Eʹsau.</span>
<span id="p710" class="sentence">26  After that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Eʹsau, so he named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them.</span>
<span id="p711" class="sentence">27  As the boys got bigger, Eʹsau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a blameless man, dwelling in tents.</span>
<span id="p712" class="sentence">28  And Isaac loved Eʹsau because it meant game in his mouth, whereas Re·bekʹah loved Jacob.</span>
<span id="p713" class="sentence">29  On one occasion Jacob was boiling some stew when Eʹsau returned from the field exhausted.</span>
<span id="p714" class="sentence">30  So Eʹsau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me some of the red stew that you have there, for I am exhausted!” That is why his name was Eʹdom.</span>
<span id="p715" class="sentence">31  To this Jacob said: “First sell me your right as firstborn!”</span>
<span id="p716" class="sentence">32  And Eʹsau continued: “Here I am about to die! What use is a birthright to me?”</span>
<span id="p717" class="sentence">33  And Jacob added: “Swear to me first!” So he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to Jacob.</span>
<span id="p718" class="sentence">34  Then Jacob gave Eʹsau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and he got up and went away. Thus Eʹsau despised the birthright.</span></p></level1>
