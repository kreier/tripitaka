<p><span id="p377" class="sentence">After this the word of Jehovah came to Aʹbram in a vision, saying: “Do not fear, Aʹbram. I am a shield for you. Your reward will be very great.”</span>
<span id="p378" class="sentence">2  Aʹbram replied: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, what will you give me, seeing that I continue childless and the one who will inherit my house is a man of Damascus, E·li·eʹzer?”</span>
<span id="p379" class="sentence">3  Aʹbram added: “You have given me no offspring, and a member of my household is succeeding me as heir.”</span>
<span id="p380" class="sentence">4  But look! Jehovah’s word in reply to him was, “This man will not succeed you as heir, but your own son will succeed you as heir.”</span>
<span id="p381" class="sentence">5  He now brought him outside and said: “Look up, please, to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to do so.” Then he said to him: “So your offspring will become.”</span>
<span id="p382" class="sentence">6  And he put faith in Jehovah, and He counted it to him as righteousness.</span>
<span id="p383" class="sentence">7  Then he added: “I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chal·deʹans to give you this land as your possession.”</span>
<span id="p384" class="sentence">8  To this he said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, how will I know that I will take possession of it?”</span>
<span id="p385" class="sentence">9  He replied to him: “Take for me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”</span>
<span id="p386" class="sentence">10  So he took all of these and cut them in two and put each part opposite the other, but he did not cut up the birds.</span>
<span id="p387" class="sentence">11  Then the birds of prey began to descend on the carcasses, but Aʹbram kept driving them away.</span>
<span id="p388" class="sentence">12  When the sun was about to set, a deep sleep fell upon Aʹbram and a great and frightening darkness descended on him.</span>
<span id="p389" class="sentence">13  Then He said to Aʹbram: “Know for certain that your offspring will be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them and afflict them for 400 years.</span>
<span id="p390" class="sentence">14  But I will judge the nation they will serve, and after that they will go out with many goods.</span>
<span id="p391" class="sentence">15  As for you, you will go to your forefathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.</span>
<span id="p392" class="sentence">16  But they will return here in the fourth generation, because the error of the Amʹor·ites has not yet reached its full measure.”</span>
<span id="p393" class="sentence">17  When the sun had set and it had become very dark, a smoking furnace appeared, and a fiery torch passed between the pieces.</span>
<span id="p394" class="sentence">18  On that day Jehovah made with Aʹbram a covenant, saying: “To your offspring I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Eu·phraʹtes:</span>
<span id="p395" class="sentence">19  the land of the Kenʹites, the Kenʹiz·zites, the Kadʹmon·ites,</span>
<span id="p396" class="sentence">20  the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Rephʹa·im,</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">21  the Amʹor·ites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the Girʹga·shites, and the Jebʹu·sites.”</span></p></level1>
