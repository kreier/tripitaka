<p><span id="p399" class="sentence">Now Aʹbram’s wife Sarʹai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian servant whose name was Haʹgar.</span>
<span id="p400" class="sentence">2  So Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “Please now! Jehovah has prevented me from bearing children. Please, have relations with my servant. Perhaps I can have children by means of her.” So Aʹbram listened to what Sarʹai said.</span>
<span id="p401" class="sentence">3  After Aʹbram had lived for ten years in the land of Caʹnaan, Aʹbram’s wife Sarʹai took her Egyptian servant Haʹgar and gave her to her husband Aʹbram as his wife.</span>
<span id="p402" class="sentence">4  So he had relations with Haʹgar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</span>
<span id="p403" class="sentence">5  At this Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “The injury done to me is your fault. I was the one who put my servant in your arms, but when she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise me. May Jehovah judge between me and you.”</span>
<span id="p404" class="sentence">6  So Aʹbram said to Sarʹai: “Look! Your servant is under your authority. Do to her whatever you think is best.” Then Sarʹai humiliated her, and she ran away from her.</span>
<span id="p405" class="sentence">7  Later Jehovah’s angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.</span>
<span id="p406" class="sentence">8  And he said: “Haʹgar, servant of Sarʹai, where have you come from and where are you going?” To this she said: “I am running away from my mistress Sarʹai.”</span>
<span id="p407" class="sentence">9  Jehovah’s angel then said to her: “Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.”</span>
<span id="p408" class="sentence">10  Then Jehovah’s angel said: “I will greatly multiply your offspring, so that they will be too numerous to count.”</span>
<span id="p409" class="sentence">11  Jehovah’s angel added: “Here you are pregnant, and you will give birth to a son, and you must name him Ishʹma·el, for Jehovah has heard your affliction.</span>
<span id="p410" class="sentence">12  He will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him, and he will dwell opposite all his brothers.”</span>
<span id="p411" class="sentence">13  Then she called on the name of Jehovah, who was speaking to her: “You are a God of sight,” for she said: “Have I here actually looked upon the one who sees me?”</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">14  That is why the well was called Beʹer-laʹhai-roi. (It is between Kaʹdesh and Beʹred.)</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">15  So Haʹgar bore to Aʹbram a son, and Aʹbram named his son, whom Haʹgar bore, Ishʹma·el.</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">16  Aʹbram was 86 years old when Haʹgar bore Ishʹma·el to him.</span></p></level1>
