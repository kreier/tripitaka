<level1><h1 id="p245">Chapter 10</h1>
<p><span id="p246" class="sentence">This is the history of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth.
Sons were born to them after the Flood.</span>
<span id="p247" class="sentence">2  The sons of Jaʹpheth were Goʹmer, Maʹgog, Maʹda·i, Jaʹvan, Tuʹbal, Meʹshech, and Tiʹras.</span>
<span id="p248" class="sentence">3  The sons of Goʹmer were Ashʹke·naz, Riʹphath, and To·garʹmah.</span>
<span id="p249" class="sentence">4  The sons of Jaʹvan were E·liʹshah, Tarʹshish, Kitʹtim, and Doʹda·nim.</span>
<span id="p250" class="sentence">5  From these the inhabitants of the islands spread into their lands, according to their languages and their families and by their nations.</span>
<span id="p251" class="sentence">6  The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizʹra·im, Put, and Caʹnaan.</span>
<span id="p252" class="sentence">7  The sons of Cush were Seʹba, Havʹi·lah, Sabʹtah, Raʹa·mah, and Sabʹte·ca.
The sons of Raʹa·mah were Sheʹba and Deʹdan.</span>
<span id="p253" class="sentence">8  Cush became father to Nimʹrod. He was the first to become a mighty one on the earth.</span>
<span id="p254" class="sentence">9  He became a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah. That is why there is a saying: “Just like Nimʹrod, a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.”</span>
<span id="p255" class="sentence">10  The beginning of his kingdom was Baʹbel, Eʹrech, Acʹcad, and Calʹneh, in the land of Shiʹnar.</span>
<span id="p256" class="sentence">11  From that land he went into As·syrʹi·a and built Ninʹe·veh, Re·hoʹboth-Ir, Caʹlah,</span>
<span id="p257" class="sentence">12  and Reʹsen, between Ninʹe·veh and Caʹlah: This is the great city.</span>
<span id="p258" class="sentence">13  Mizʹra·im became father to Luʹdim, Anʹa·mim, Le·haʹbim, Naph·tuʹhim,</span>
<span id="p259" class="sentence">14  Path·ruʹsim, Cas·luʹhim (from whom the Phi·lisʹtines came), and Caphʹto·rim.</span>
<span id="p260" class="sentence">15  Caʹnaan became father to Siʹdon, his firstborn, and Heth,</span>
<span id="p261" class="sentence">16  as well as the Jebʹu·site, the Amʹor·ite, the Girʹga·shite,</span>
<span id="p262" class="sentence">17  the Hiʹvite, the Arkʹite, the Siʹnite,</span>
<span id="p263" class="sentence">18  the Arʹvad·ite, the Zemʹa·rite, and the Haʹmath·ite. Afterward, the families of the Caʹnaan·ites were scattered.</span>
<span id="p264" class="sentence">19  So the boundary of the Caʹnaan·ites was from Siʹdon as far as Geʹrar, near Gazʹa, as far as Sodʹom, Go·morʹrah, Adʹmah, and Ze·boiʹim, near Laʹsha.</span>
<span id="p265" class="sentence">20  These were the sons of Ham according to their families and their languages, by their lands and their nations.</span>
<span id="p266" class="sentence">21  Children were also born to Shem, the forefather of all the sons of Eʹber and the brother of Jaʹpheth the oldest.</span>
<span id="p267" class="sentence">22  The sons of Shem were Eʹlam, Asʹshur, Ar·pachʹshad, Lud, and Aʹram.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">23  The sons of Aʹram were Uz, Hul, Geʹther, and Mash.</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">24  Ar·pachʹshad became father to Sheʹlah, and Sheʹlah became father to Eʹber.</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">25  Two sons were born to Eʹber. The name of the one was Peʹleg, because in his lifetime the earth was divided. The name of his brother was Jokʹtan.</span>
<span id="p271" class="sentence">26  Jokʹtan became father to Al·moʹdad, Sheʹleph, Ha·zar·maʹveth, Jeʹrah,</span>
<span id="p272" class="sentence">27  Ha·doʹram, Uʹzal, Dikʹlah,</span>
<span id="p273" class="sentence">28  Oʹbal, A·bimʹa·el, Sheʹba,</span>
<span id="p274" class="sentence">29  Oʹphir, Havʹi·lah, and Joʹbab; all of these were the sons of Jokʹtan.</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">30  Their place of dwelling extended from Meʹsha as far as Seʹphar, the mountainous region of the East.</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">31  These were the sons of Shem according to their families and their languages, by their lands and their nations.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">32  These were the families of the sons of Noah according to their family lines and by their nations. From these the nations were spread abroad in the earth after the Flood.</span></p></level1>
