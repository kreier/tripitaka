<p><span id="p333" class="sentence">Aʹbram then went up out of Egypt to the Negʹeb, he and his wife and all that he had, together with Lot.</span>
<span id="p334" class="sentence">2  Aʹbram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.</span>
<span id="p335" class="sentence">3  He camped in one place after another as he traveled from the Negʹeb to Bethʹel, until he arrived at the place where his tent had been between Bethʹel and Aʹi,</span>
<span id="p336" class="sentence">4  to the place where he had previously built an altar. There Aʹbram called on the name of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p337" class="sentence">5  Now Lot, who was traveling with Aʹbram, also owned sheep, cattle, and tents.</span>
<span id="p338" class="sentence">6  So the land did not allow for all of them to stay in the same place; their goods had become so many that they could no longer dwell together.</span>
<span id="p339" class="sentence">7  As a result, a quarrel arose between the herders of Aʹbram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock. (At that time the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites were dwelling in the land.)</span>
<span id="p340" class="sentence">8  So Aʹbram said to Lot: “Please, there should be no quarreling between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.</span>
<span id="p341" class="sentence">9  Is not the whole land available to you? Please, separate from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.”</span>
<span id="p342" class="sentence">10  So Lot raised his eyes and saw that the whole district of the Jordan was a well-watered region (before Jehovah destroyed Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah), like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as far as Zoʹar.</span>
<span id="p343" class="sentence">11  Then Lot chose for himself the whole district of the Jordan, and Lot moved his camp to the east. So they separated from each other.</span>
<span id="p344" class="sentence">12  Aʹbram lived in the land of Caʹnaan, but Lot lived among the cities of the district. Finally he set up his tent near Sodʹom.</span>
<span id="p345" class="sentence">13  Now the men of Sodʹom were wicked, gross sinners against Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p346" class="sentence">14  Jehovah said to Aʹbram, after Lot had separated from him: “Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place where you are, to the north and south, east and west,</span>
<span id="p347" class="sentence">15  because all the land that you see, I will give to you and your offspring as a lasting possession.</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">16  And I will make your offspring like the dust particles of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust particles of the earth, then your offspring could be counted.</span>
<span id="p349" class="sentence">17  Get up, travel through the length and breadth of the land, for to you I am going to give it.”</span>
<span id="p350" class="sentence">18  So Aʹbram continued to live in tents. Later he came and dwelled among the big trees of Mamʹre, which are in Hebʹron, and there he built an altar to Jehovah.</span></p></level1>
