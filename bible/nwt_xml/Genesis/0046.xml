<p><span id="p1434" class="sentence">So Israel took all that he had and departed. When he arrived at Beʹer-sheʹba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.</span>
<span id="p1435" class="sentence">2  Then God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said: “Jacob, Jacob!” to which he said: “Here I am!”</span>
<span id="p1436" class="sentence">3  He said: “I am the true God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.</span>
<span id="p1437" class="sentence">4  I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you back from there, and Joseph will lay his hand on your eyes.”</span>
<span id="p1438" class="sentence">5  After that Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba, and the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharʹaoh had sent to transport him.</span>
<span id="p1439" class="sentence">6  They took along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of Caʹnaan. And so they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him.</span>
<span id="p1440" class="sentence">7  He brought with him into Egypt his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters—all his offspring.</span>
<span id="p1441" class="sentence">8  Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn was Reuʹben.</span>
<span id="p1442" class="sentence">9  The sons of Reuʹben were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and Carʹmi.</span>
<span id="p1443" class="sentence">10  The sons of Simʹe·on were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin, Oʹhad, Jaʹchin, Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman.</span>
<span id="p1444" class="sentence">11  The sons of Leʹvi were Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi.</span>
<span id="p1445" class="sentence">12  The sons of Judah were Er, Oʹnan, Sheʹlah, Peʹrez, and Zeʹrah. However, Er and Oʹnan died in the land of Caʹnaan.
The sons of Peʹrez came to be Hezʹron and Haʹmul.</span>
<span id="p1446" class="sentence">13  The sons of Isʹsa·char were Toʹla, Puʹvah, Iob, and Shimʹron.</span>
<span id="p1447" class="sentence">14  The sons of Zebʹu·lun were Seʹred, Eʹlon, and Jahʹle·el.</span>
<span id="p1448" class="sentence">15  These are the sons of Leʹah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padʹdan-aʹram, together with his daughter Diʹnah. All his sons and his daughters numbered 33.</span>
<span id="p1449" class="sentence">16  The sons of Gad were Ziphʹi·on, Hagʹgi, Shuʹni, Ezʹbon, Eʹri, Ar·oʹdi, and A·reʹli.</span>
<span id="p1450" class="sentence">17  The sons of Ashʹer were Imʹnah, Ishʹvah, Ishʹvi, and Be·riʹah, and their sister was Seʹrah.
The sons of Be·riʹah were Heʹber and Malʹchi·el.</span>
<span id="p1451" class="sentence">18  These are the sons of Zilʹpah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Leʹah. She bore these to Jacob: 16 persons in all.</span>
<span id="p1452" class="sentence">19  The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</span>
<span id="p1453" class="sentence">20  There were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt Ma·nasʹseh and Eʹphra·im, whom Asʹe·nath the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On bore to him.</span>
<span id="p1454" class="sentence">21  The sons of Benjamin were Beʹla, Beʹcher, Ashʹbel, Geʹra, Naʹa·man, Eʹhi, Rosh, Mupʹpim, Hupʹpim, and Ard.</span>
<span id="p1455" class="sentence">22  These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: 14 persons in all.</span>
<span id="p1456" class="sentence">23  The son of Dan was Huʹshim.</span>
<span id="p1457" class="sentence">24  The sons of Naphʹta·li were Jahʹze·el, Guʹni, Jeʹzer, and Shilʹlem.</span>
<span id="p1458" class="sentence">25  These are the sons of Bilʹhah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore these to Jacob: seven persons in all.</span>
<span id="p1459" class="sentence">26  All those who descended from Jacob and went into Egypt with him, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons, were 66.</span>
<span id="p1460" class="sentence">27  Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt were two. All the people of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were 70.</span>
<span id="p1461" class="sentence">28  Jacob sent Judah ahead to tell Joseph that he was on the way to Goʹshen. When they came into the land of Goʹshen,</span>
<span id="p1462" class="sentence">29  Joseph had his chariot prepared and went up to meet Israel his father at Goʹshen. When he presented himself to him, he at once embraced him and wept for some time.</span>
<span id="p1463" class="sentence">30  Then Israel said to Joseph: “Now I am ready to die; I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”</span>
<span id="p1464" class="sentence">31  Joseph then said to his brothers and to his father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Pharʹaoh and tell him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Caʹnaan have come here to me.</span>
<span id="p1465" class="sentence">32  The men are shepherds, and they raise livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’</span>
<span id="p1466" class="sentence">33  When Pharʹaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’</span>
<span id="p1467" class="sentence">34  you must say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock from our youth until now, both we and our forefathers,’ so that you may dwell in the land of Goʹshen, for every herder of sheep is detestable to the Egyptians.”</span></p></level1>
