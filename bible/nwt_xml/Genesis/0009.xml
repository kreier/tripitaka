<p><span id="p216" class="sentence">God went on to bless Noah and his sons and to say to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.</span>
<span id="p217" class="sentence">2  A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the ground and upon all the fish of the sea. They are now given into your hand.</span>
<span id="p218" class="sentence">3  Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give them all to you.</span>
<span id="p219" class="sentence">4  Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.</span>
<span id="p220" class="sentence">5  Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your lifeblood. I will demand an accounting from every living creature; and from each man I will demand an accounting for the life of his brother.</span>
<span id="p221" class="sentence">6  Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image He made man.</span>
<span id="p222" class="sentence">7  As for you, be fruitful and become many, and increase abundantly on the earth and multiply.”</span>
<span id="p223" class="sentence">8  Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:</span>
<span id="p224" class="sentence">9  “I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,</span>
<span id="p225" class="sentence">10  and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth.</span>
<span id="p226" class="sentence">11  Yes, I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.”</span>
<span id="p227" class="sentence">12  And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations.</span>
<span id="p228" class="sentence">13  I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.</span>
<span id="p229" class="sentence">14  Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.</span>
<span id="p230" class="sentence">15  And I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living creature of every kind; and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.</span>
<span id="p231" class="sentence">16  And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind on the earth.”</span>
<span id="p232" class="sentence">17  God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”</span>
<span id="p233" class="sentence">18  Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. Ham later became the father of Caʹnaan.</span>
<span id="p234" class="sentence">19  These three were Noah’s sons, and all the earth’s population came from them and spread abroad.</span>
<span id="p235" class="sentence">20  Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.</span>
<span id="p236" class="sentence">21  When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself inside his tent.</span>
<span id="p237" class="sentence">22  Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside.</span>
<span id="p238" class="sentence">23  So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.</span>
<span id="p239" class="sentence">24  When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,</span>
<span id="p240" class="sentence">25  he said:
“Cursed be Caʹnaan.
Let him become the lowest slave to his brothers.”</span>
<span id="p241" class="sentence">26  And he added:
“Praised be Jehovah, the God of Shem,And let Caʹnaan become a slave to him.</span>
<span id="p242" class="sentence">27  Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth,And let him reside in the tents of Shem.
Let Caʹnaan become a slave to him also.”</span>
<span id="p243" class="sentence">28  Noah continued to live for 350 years after the Flood.</span>
<span id="p244" class="sentence">29  So all the days of Noah amounted to 950 years, and he died.</span></p></level1>
