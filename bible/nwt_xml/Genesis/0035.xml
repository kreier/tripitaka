<p><span id="p1048" class="sentence">After that God said to Jacob: “Rise, go up to Bethʹel and dwell there, and make an altar there to the true God, who appeared to you when you were running away from Eʹsau your brother.”</span>
<span id="p1049" class="sentence">2  Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him: “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst, and cleanse yourselves and change your garments,</span>
<span id="p1050" class="sentence">3  and let us rise and go up to Bethʹel. There I will make an altar to the true God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”</span>
<span id="p1051" class="sentence">4  So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the big tree that was close to Sheʹchem.</span>
<span id="p1052" class="sentence">5  When they traveled on, the terror of God struck the cities around them, so they did not chase after the sons of Jacob.</span>
<span id="p1053" class="sentence">6  Jacob eventually came to Luz, that is, Bethʹel, in the land of Caʹnaan, he and all the people with him.</span>
<span id="p1054" class="sentence">7  There he built an altar and called the place El-bethʹel, because there the true God had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother.</span>
<span id="p1055" class="sentence">8  Later Debʹo·rah, Re·bekʹah’s nurse, died and was buried at the foot of Bethʹel under an oak. So he named it Alʹlon-bacʹuth.</span>
<span id="p1056" class="sentence">9  God appeared to Jacob once again while he was coming from Padʹdan-aʹram and blessed him.</span>
<span id="p1057" class="sentence">10  God said to him: “Your name is Jacob. Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel will be your name.” And he began to call him Israel.</span>
<span id="p1058" class="sentence">11  God further said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and become many. Nations and a congregation of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you.</span>
<span id="p1059" class="sentence">12  As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.”</span>
<span id="p1060" class="sentence">13  Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.</span>
<span id="p1061" class="sentence">14  So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.</span>
<span id="p1062" class="sentence">15  And Jacob continued to call the place where God had spoken with him Bethʹel.</span>
<span id="p1063" class="sentence">16  Then they pulled away from Bethʹel. And while they were still some distance from Ephʹrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was very difficult.</span>
<span id="p1064" class="sentence">17  But while she was struggling to deliver the child, the midwife said to her: “Do not be afraid, for you will have this son also.”</span>
<span id="p1065" class="sentence">18  Just as her life was slipping away (for she was dying), she named him Ben-oʹni, but his father called him Benjamin.</span>
<span id="p1066" class="sentence">19  So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephʹrath, that is, Bethʹle·hem.</span>
<span id="p1067" class="sentence">20  Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.</span>
<span id="p1068" class="sentence">21  After that Israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of Eʹder.</span>
<span id="p1069" class="sentence">22  Once while Israel was dwelling in that land, Reuʹben went and lay down with Bilʹhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.
So there were 12 sons of Jacob.</span>
<span id="p1070" class="sentence">23  The sons by Leʹah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuʹben, then Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun.</span>
<span id="p1071" class="sentence">24  The sons by Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</span>
<span id="p1072" class="sentence">25  And the sons by Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphʹta·li.</span>
<span id="p1073" class="sentence">26  And the sons by Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, were Gad and Ashʹer. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Padʹdan-aʹram.</span>
<span id="p1074" class="sentence">27  Jacob eventually came to where his father Isaac was at Mamʹre, to Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, where Abraham and also Isaac had resided as foreigners.</span>
<span id="p1075" class="sentence">28  Isaac lived to be 180 years old.</span>
<span id="p1076" class="sentence">29  Then Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, after a long and satisfying life; and his sons Eʹsau and Jacob buried him.</span></p></level1>
