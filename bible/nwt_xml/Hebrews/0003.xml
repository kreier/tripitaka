<p><span id="p36" class="sentence">Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest whom we acknowledge—Jesus.</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">2  He was faithful to the One who appointed him, just as Moses also was in all the house of that One.</span>
<span id="p38" class="sentence">3  For he is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, since the one who constructs a house has more honor than the house itself.</span>
<span id="p39" class="sentence">4  Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">5  Now Moses was faithful as an attendant in all the house of that One as a testimony of the things that were to be spoken afterward,</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">6  but Christ was faithful as a son over God’s house. We are His house if, indeed, we hold on firmly to our freeness of speech and the hope of which we boast down to the end.</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">7  Therefore, just as the holy spirit says, “Today if you listen to his voice,</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">8  do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing in the wilderness,</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">9  where your forefathers put me to the test and tried me, despite seeing my works for 40 years.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">10  This is why I became disgusted with this generation and said: ‘They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not come to know my ways.’</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">11  So I swore in my anger: ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">12  Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God;</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">13  but keep on encouraging one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">14  For we actually become partakers of the Christ only if we hold firmly down to the end the confidence we had at the beginning.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">15  As it is said, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger.”</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">16  For who heard and yet provoked him to bitter anger? Was it not, in fact, all those who went out of Egypt under Moses?</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">17  Moreover, with whom did God become disgusted for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">18  And to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? Was it not to those who acted disobediently?</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">19  So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.</span></p></level1>
