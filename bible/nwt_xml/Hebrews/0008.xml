<p><span id="p138" class="sentence">Now this is the main point of what we are saying: We have such a high priest as this, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">2  a minister of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah set up, and not man.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">3  For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">4  If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the Law.</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">5  These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to construct the tent, was given the divine command: For He says: “See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">6  But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry because he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established on better promises.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">7  If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second.</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">8  For he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! The days are coming,’ says Jehovah, ‘when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant.</span>
<span id="p146" class="sentence">9  It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not remain in my covenant, so I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p147" class="sentence">10  “‘For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah. ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I will write them. And I will become their God, and they will become my people.</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">11  “‘And they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!” For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them.</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">12  For I will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and I will no longer call their sins to mind.’”</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">13  In his saying “a new covenant,” he has made the former one obsolete. Now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.</span></p></level1>
