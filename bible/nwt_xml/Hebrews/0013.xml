<level1><h1 id="p291">Chapter 13</h1>
<p><span id="p292" class="sentence">Let your brotherly love continue.</span>
<span id="p293" class="sentence">2  Do not forget hospitality, for through it some unknowingly entertained angels.</span>
<span id="p294" class="sentence">3  Keep in mind those in prison, as though you were imprisoned with them, and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in the body.</span>
<span id="p295" class="sentence">4  Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers.</span>
<span id="p296" class="sentence">5  Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things. For he has said: “I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.”</span>
<span id="p297" class="sentence">6  So that we may be of good courage and say: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?”</span>
<span id="p298" class="sentence">7  Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith.</span>
<span id="p299" class="sentence">8  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.</span>
<span id="p300" class="sentence">9  Do not be led astray by various and strange teachings, for it is better for the heart to be strengthened by undeserved kindness than by foods, which do not benefit those occupied with them.</span>
<span id="p301" class="sentence">10  We have an altar from which those who offer sacred service at the tent have no authority to eat.</span>
<span id="p302" class="sentence">11  For the bodies of those animals whose blood is taken into the holy place as a sin offering by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.</span>
<span id="p303" class="sentence">12  Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people with his own blood.</span>
<span id="p304" class="sentence">13  Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach he bore,</span>
<span id="p305" class="sentence">14  for we do not have here a city that remains, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come.</span>
<span id="p306" class="sentence">15  Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of our lips that make public declaration to his name.</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">16  Moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">17  Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over you as those who will render an account, so that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you.</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">18  Keep praying for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">19  But I especially urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">20  Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, with the blood of an everlasting covenant,</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">21  equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us through Jesus Christ what is well-pleasing in his sight, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">22  Now I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to this word of encouragement, for I have written you a short letter.</span>
<span id="p314" class="sentence">23  I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon, I will be with him when I see you.</span>
<span id="p315" class="sentence">24  Give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead among you and to all the holy ones. Those in Italy send you their greetings.</span>
<span id="p316" class="sentence">25  The undeserved kindness be with all of you.</span></p></level1>
