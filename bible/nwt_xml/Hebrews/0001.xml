<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">Long ago God spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many occasions and in many ways.</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  Now at the end of these days he has spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. And after he had made a purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  So he has become better than the angels to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”? And again: “I will become his father, and he will become my son”?</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all of God’s angels do obeisance to him.”</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  Also, he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.”</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  But about the Son, he says: “God is your throne forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.”</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  And: “At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out,</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.”</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  But about which of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  Are they not all spirits for holy service, sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?</span></p></level1>
