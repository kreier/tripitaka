<p><span id="p56" class="sentence">Therefore, since a promise of entering into his rest remains, let us be on guard for fear someone among you seems to fall short of it.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">2  For we have also had the good news declared to us, just as they had; but the word that they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">3  For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “So I swore in my anger, ‘They will not enter into my rest,’” although his works were finished from the founding of the world.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">4  For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">5  and here again he says: “They will not enter into my rest.”</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">6  Therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">7  he again marks off a certain day by saying long afterward in David’s psalm, “Today”; just as it has been said above, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.”</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">8  For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, God would not afterward have spoken of another day.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">9  So there remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">10  For the man who has entered into God’s rest has also rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">11  Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same pattern of disobedience.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">12  For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">13  And there is not a creation that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">14  Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold on to our public declaration of him.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">15  For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have, but without sin.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">16  Let us, then, approach the throne of undeserved kindness with freeness of speech, so that we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time.</span></p></level1>
