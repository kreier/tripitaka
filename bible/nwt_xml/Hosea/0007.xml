<level1><h1 id="p91">Chapter 7</h1>
<p><span id="p92" class="sentence">“At the time when I would heal Israel,The error of Eʹphra·im is also exposed,And the wickedness of Sa·marʹi·a.
For they practice deception;Thieves break in and marauder bands raid outside.</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">2  But they do not say in their heart that I will remember all their wickedness.
Now their dealings are all around them;They are right in front of my face.</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">3  They make the king rejoice by their wickedness,And princes by their deceit.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">4  All of them are adulterers,Burning like an oven fired by a baker,Who stops stirring the fire after kneading the dough until it is leavened.</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">5  On the day of our king, princes have become sick—They are enraged because of wine.
He has reached out his hand to ridiculers.</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">6  For they approach with hearts burning like an oven.
All night long the baker sleeps;In the morning the oven blazes like a flaming fire.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">7  All of them are hot like an oven,And they devour their rulers.
All their kings have fallen;No one among them calls out to me.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">8  Eʹphra·im mixes with the nations.
Eʹphra·im is like a round cake left unturned.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">9  Strangers have consumed his strength, but he does not know it.
And his gray hairs have turned white, but he does not notice it.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">10  The pride of Israel has testified against him,But they have not returned to Jehovah their God,Nor have they looked for him despite all of this.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">11  Eʹphra·im is like a simpleminded dove, lacking good sense.
They have called out to Egypt; they have gone to As·syrʹi·a.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">12  Wherever they go, I will spread my net over them.
I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens.
I will discipline them according to the warning given to their assembly.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">13  Woe to them, for they have fled from me!
Devastation to them, for they have transgressed against me!
I was ready to redeem them, but they have spoken lies against me.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">14  From their heart they did not call to me for help,Although they kept wailing on their beds.
For their grain and new wine they would slash themselves;They turn against me.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">15  Although I disciplined them and strengthened their arms,They are against me, scheming what is bad.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">16  They changed course, but not to anything loftier;They were as unreliable as a loose bow.
Their princes will fall by the sword because of their defiant tongues.
For this they will be an object of ridicule in the land of Egypt.”</span></p></level1>
