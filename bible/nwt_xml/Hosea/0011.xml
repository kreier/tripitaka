<level1><h1 id="p157">Chapter 11</h1>
<p><span id="p158" class="sentence">“When Israel was a boy, I loved him,And out of Egypt I called my son.</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">2  The more they called them,The more they went away from them.
They kept sacrificing to the Baʹal imagesAnd offering sacrifices to the graven images.</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">3  But it was I who taught Eʹphra·im to walk, taking them in my arms;And they did not acknowledge that I had healed them.</span>
<span id="p161" class="sentence">4  With the ropes of men I kept drawing them, with the cords of love;And I was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jaws,And I gently brought food to each one.</span>
<span id="p162" class="sentence">5  They will not return to the land of Egypt, but As·syrʹi·a will be their king,Because they refused to return to me.</span>
<span id="p163" class="sentence">6  And a sword will whirl against his citiesAnd destroy his bars and devour them because of their schemes.</span>
<span id="p164" class="sentence">7  My people are bent on unfaithfulness to me.
Though they called them upward, no one rises up.</span>
<span id="p165" class="sentence">8  How can I give you up, O Eʹphra·im?
How can I hand you over, O Israel?
How can I treat you like Adʹmah?
How can I make you like Ze·boiʹim?
I have had a change of heart;At the same time my compassions are stirred.</span>
<span id="p166" class="sentence">9  I will not vent my burning anger.
I will not destroy Eʹphra·im again,For I am God and not man,The Holy One in your midst;And I will not come against you in fury.</span>
<span id="p167" class="sentence">10  They will walk after Jehovah, and he will roar like a lion;When he roars, his sons will come trembling from the west.</span>
<span id="p168" class="sentence">11  They will tremble like a bird when they come out of Egypt,Like a dove out of the land of As·syrʹi·a;And I will settle them in their houses,” declares Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p169" class="sentence">12  “Eʹphra·im has surrounded me with lies,And the house of Israel with deceit.
But Judah still roams with God,And he is faithful to the Most Holy One.”</span></p></level1>
