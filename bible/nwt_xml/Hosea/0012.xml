<p><span id="p171" class="sentence">“Eʹphra·im is feeding on wind.
He chases after the east wind all day long.
He multiplies lies and violence.
They make a covenant with As·syrʹi·a and take oil to Egypt.</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">2  Jehovah has a legal case against Judah;He will call for an accounting against Jacob according to his ways,And he will repay him according to his deeds.</span>
<span id="p173" class="sentence">3  In the womb he seized his brother by the heel,And with his vigor he contended with God.</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">4  He kept contending with an angel and prevailed.
He wept and begged for his favor.”
He found him at Bethʹel, and there He spoke with us,</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">5  Jehovah the God of armies,Jehovah is his memorial name.</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">6  “So return to your God,Maintain loyal love and justice,And always hope in your God.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">7  But in the hand of the tradesman are deceptive scales;He loves to defraud.</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">8  Eʹphra·im keeps saying, ‘Indeed, I have become rich;I have found wealth.
And in all my toil, they will not find anything wrong or sinful.’</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">9  But I am Jehovah your God from the land of Egypt.
I will again make you dwell in tentsAs in the days of an appointed time.</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">10  I spoke to the prophets,I multiplied their visions,And I spoke parables through the prophets.</span>
<span id="p181" class="sentence">11  With Gilʹe·ad there has been deception and untruth.
In Gilʹgal they have sacrificed bulls,And their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the field.</span>
<span id="p182" class="sentence">12  Jacob ran away to the territory of Aʹram;Israel served there for a wife,And for a wife he guarded sheep.</span>
<span id="p183" class="sentence">13  By a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt,And by a prophet he was guarded.</span>
<span id="p184" class="sentence">14  Eʹphra·im has caused bitter offense;His bloodguilt remains on him;His Lord will repay him for his reproach.”</span></p></level1>
