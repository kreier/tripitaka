<level1><h1 id="p63">Chapter 5</h1>
<p><span id="p64" class="sentence">“Hear this, you priests,Pay attention, O house of Israel,Listen, O house of the king,For the judgment involves you;Because you are a trap to MizʹpahAnd a net spread over Taʹbor.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">2  And those falling away have sunk deep in slaughter,And I am warning all of them.</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">3  I know Eʹphra·im,And Israel is not hidden from me.
For now, O Eʹphra·im, you have acted promiscuously;Israel has defiled itself.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">4  Their dealings do not permit them to return to their God,Because there is a spirit of prostitution among them;And Jehovah they do not acknowledge.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">5  The pride of Israel has testified against him;Both Israel and Eʹphra·im have stumbled in their error,And Judah has stumbled with them.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">6  With their flock and their herd they went to look for Jehovah,But they could not find him.
He had drawn away from them.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">7  They have betrayed Jehovah,For they have fathered foreign sons.
Now a month will devour them and their portions.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">8  Blow a horn in Gibʹe·ah, a trumpet in Raʹmah!
Shout a war cry at Beth-aʹven—after you, O Benjamin!</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">9  O Eʹphra·im, you will become an object of horror in the day of punishment.
I have made known what will surely happen among the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">10  The princes of Judah are like those moving a boundary.
I will pour out my fury on them like water.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">11  Eʹphra·im is oppressed, crushed by judgment,For he was determined to follow after his adversary.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">12  So I was like a moth to Eʹphra·imAnd like rottenness to the house of Judah.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">13  When Eʹphra·im saw his sickness, and Judah his ulcer,Eʹphra·im went to As·syrʹi·a and sent to a great king.
But he was unable to heal you,And he could not cure your ulcer.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">14  For I will be like a young lion to Eʹphra·im,And like a strong lion to the house of Judah.
I myself will tear to pieces and go away;I will carry them off, and no one will rescue them.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">15  I will go away and return to my place until they bear the consequences of their guilt,And then they will seek my favor.
When they are in distress, they will seek me.”</span></p></level1>
