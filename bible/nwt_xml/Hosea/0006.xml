<p><span id="p80" class="sentence">“Come, and let us return to Jehovah,For he has torn us to pieces, but he will heal us.
He struck us, but he will bind our wounds.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">2  He will revive us after two days.
On the third day he will raise us up,And we will live before him.</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">3  We will know, we will earnestly seek to know Jehovah.
His going out is as certain as the dawn;He will come to us like a pouring rain,Like a spring rain that saturates the earth.”</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">4  “What should I do with you, Eʹphra·im?
What should I do with you, Judah?
For your loyal love is like the morning clouds,Like the dew that quickly vanishes.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">5  That is why I will cut them down by means of the prophets;I will kill them with the words of my mouth.
And the judgments on you will shine as the light.</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">6  For in loyal love I delight, not in sacrifice,And in the knowledge of God, rather than in whole burnt offerings.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">7  But they, like mere men, have violated the covenant.
There they have betrayed me.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">8  Gilʹe·ad is a town of evildoers,Covered with footprints of blood.</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">9  The company of priests are like marauder bands lying in ambush for a man.
They murder on the road at Sheʹchem,For their conduct is shameful.</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">10  I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel.
There Eʹphra·im practices prostitution;Israel has defiled itself.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">11  Furthermore, O Judah, a harvest is set for you,When I gather back the captives of my people.”</span></p></level1>
