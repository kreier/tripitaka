<level1><h1 id="p76">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p77" class="sentence">Once again he entered into a synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">2  So they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him.</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">3  He said to the man with the withered hand: “Get up and come to the center.”</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">4  Next he said to them: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">5  After looking around at them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts, he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">6  At that the Pharisees went out and immediately began holding council with the party followers of Herod against him, in order to kill him.</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">7  But Jesus departed for the sea along with his disciples, and a great multitude from Galʹi·lee and from Ju·deʹa followed him.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">8  Even from Jerusalem and from Id·u·meʹa and from across the Jordan and from around Tyre and Siʹdon, a great multitude came to him when they heard about the many things he was doing.</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">9  And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that the crowd would not press in on him.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">10  Because he cured many, all those who had serious diseases were crowding around him to touch him.</span>
<span id="p87" class="sentence">11  Even the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before him and cry out and say: “You are the Son of God.”</span>
<span id="p88" class="sentence">12  But many times he sternly ordered them not to make him known.</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">13  He ascended a mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">14  And he formed a group of 12, whom he also named apostles, those who were to accompany him and whom he would send out to preach</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">15  and to have authority to expel demons.</span>
<span id="p92" class="sentence">16  And the group of 12 that he formed were Simon, to whom he also gave the name Peter,</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">17  James the son of Zebʹe·dee and John the brother of James (he also gave these the name Bo·a·nerʹges, which means “Sons of Thunder”),</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">18  Andrew, Philip, Bar·tholʹo·mew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Al·phaeʹus, Thad·daeʹus, Simon the Ca·na·naeʹan,</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">19  and Judas Is·carʹi·ot, who later betrayed him.
Then he went into a house,</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">20  and again the crowd gathered, so that they were not able even to eat a meal.</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">21  But when his relatives heard about it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying: “He has gone out of his mind.”</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">22  Also, the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying: “He has Be·elʹze·bub, and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons.”</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">23  So after calling them to him, he spoke to them with illustrations: “How can Satan expel Satan?</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">24  If a kingdom becomes divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">25  and if a house becomes divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">26  Also, if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he cannot stand but is coming to an end.</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">27  In fact, no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">28  Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men, no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak.</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">29  But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin.”</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">30  He said this because they were saying: “He has an unclean spirit.”</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">31  Now his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">32  As there was a crowd sitting around him, they said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">33  But he replied to them: “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">34  Then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said: “See, my mother and my brothers!</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">35  Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.”</span></p></level1>
