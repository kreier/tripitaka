<p><span id="p589" class="sentence">Joʹtham was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Je·ruʹshah the daughter of Zaʹdok.</span>
<span id="p590" class="sentence">2  He kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Uz·ziʹah had done, except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah. But the people were still acting ruinously.</span>
<span id="p591" class="sentence">3  He built the upper gate of Jehovah’s house, and he did much building on the wall of Oʹphel.</span>
<span id="p592" class="sentence">4  He also built cities in the mountainous region of Judah, and he built fortified places and towers in the wooded areas.</span>
<span id="p593" class="sentence">5  He waged war against the king of the Amʹmon·ites and eventually prevailed against them, so that the Amʹmon·ites gave him in that year 100 silver talents, 10,000 cor measures of wheat, and 10,000 of barley. The Amʹmon·ites also paid this to him in the second and third years.</span>
<span id="p594" class="sentence">6  So Joʹtham kept growing strong, for he established his ways before Jehovah his God.</span>
<span id="p595" class="sentence">7  As for the rest of the history of Joʹtham, all his wars and his ways, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah.</span>
<span id="p596" class="sentence">8  He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p597" class="sentence">9  Then Joʹtham was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son Aʹhaz became king in his place.</span></p></level1>
