<p><span id="p347" class="sentence">And his son Je·hoshʹa·phat became king in his place, and he strengthened his position over Israel.</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">2  He stationed military forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Eʹphra·im that Aʹsa his father had captured.</span>
<span id="p349" class="sentence">3  Jehovah continued with Je·hoshʹa·phat because he walked in the former ways of his forefather David and did not search for the Baʹals.</span>
<span id="p350" class="sentence">4  For he searched for the God of his father and followed his commandment and not the practices of Israel.</span>
<span id="p351" class="sentence">5  Jehovah kept the kingdom firmly established in his hand; and all Judah continued to give gifts to Je·hoshʹa·phat, and he had riches and glory in abundance.</span>
<span id="p352" class="sentence">6  His heart became bold in the ways of Jehovah, and he even removed the high places and the sacred poles from Judah.</span>
<span id="p353" class="sentence">7  In the third year of his reign he sent for his princes, Ben-haʹil, O·ba·diʹah, Zech·a·riʹah, Ne·thanʹel, and Mi·caiʹah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</span>
<span id="p354" class="sentence">8  There were Levites with them: She·maiʹah, Neth·a·niʹah, Zeb·a·diʹah, Asʹa·hel, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·honʹa·than, Ad·o·niʹjah, To·biʹjah, and Tob-ad·o·niʹjah, and along with them E·lishʹa·ma and Je·hoʹram the priests.</span>
<span id="p355" class="sentence">9  They began teaching in Judah, taking with them the book of Jehovah’s Law, and they went around through all the cities of Judah teaching among the people.</span>
<span id="p356" class="sentence">10  And the dread of Jehovah came upon all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, and they did not fight against Je·hoshʹa·phat.</span>
<span id="p357" class="sentence">11  And the Phi·lisʹtines brought to Je·hoshʹa·phat gifts and money as tribute. The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats from their flocks.</span>
<span id="p358" class="sentence">12  Je·hoshʹa·phat grew greater and greater, and he continued building fortified places and storage cities in Judah.</span>
<span id="p359" class="sentence">13  He carried out extensive projects in the cities of Judah, and he had soldiers, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem.</span>
<span id="p360" class="sentence">14  These were grouped by their paternal houses: of Judah the chiefs of thousands, Adʹnah the chief, and with him were 300,000 mighty warriors.</span>
<span id="p361" class="sentence">15  And under his command was Je·ho·haʹnan the chief, and with him were 280,000.</span>
<span id="p362" class="sentence">16  And also under his command was Am·a·siʹah the son of Zichʹri, who volunteered for Jehovah’s service, and with him were 200,000 mighty warriors.</span>
<span id="p363" class="sentence">17  And out of Benjamin was E·liʹa·da, a mighty warrior, and with him were 200,000 men equipped with the bow and shield.</span>
<span id="p364" class="sentence">18  And under his command was Je·hozʹa·bad, and with him were 180,000 men equipped for the army.</span>
<span id="p365" class="sentence">19  These were ministering to the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</span></p></level1>
