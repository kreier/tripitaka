<p><span id="p537" class="sentence">King Hiʹram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timbers, stonemasons, and woodworkers to build a house for him.</span>
<span id="p538" class="sentence">2  And David knew that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel, for his kingship was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.</span>
<span id="p539" class="sentence">3  David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David became father to more sons and daughters.</span>
<span id="p540" class="sentence">4  These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Sham·muʹa, Shoʹbab, Nathan, Solʹo·mon,</span>
<span id="p541" class="sentence">5  Ibʹhar, E·liʹshu·a, Elʹpe·let,</span>
<span id="p542" class="sentence">6  Noʹgah, Neʹpheg, Ja·phiʹa,</span>
<span id="p543" class="sentence">7  E·lishʹa·ma, Be·e·liʹa·da, and E·liphʹe·let.</span>
<span id="p544" class="sentence">8  When the Phi·lisʹtines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, all the Phi·lisʹtines came up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went out against them.</span>
<span id="p545" class="sentence">9  Then the Phi·lisʹtines came in and kept making raids in the Valley of Rephʹa·im.</span>
<span id="p546" class="sentence">10  David inquired of God, saying: “Should I go up against the Phi·lisʹtines? Will you give them into my hand?” At this Jehovah said to him: “Go up, and I will surely give them into your hand.”</span>
<span id="p547" class="sentence">11  So David went up to Baʹal-pe·raʹzim, and he struck them down there. At that David said: “The true God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a breach made by waters.” That is why they named that place Baʹal-pe·raʹzim.</span>
<span id="p548" class="sentence">12  The Phi·lisʹtines abandoned their gods there, and when David gave the order, these were burned in the fire.</span>
<span id="p549" class="sentence">13  Later the Phi·lisʹtines once again made a raid in the valley.</span>
<span id="p550" class="sentence">14  David again inquired of God, but the true God said to him: “Do not go directly up after them. Instead, go around behind them, and come against them in front of the baʹca bushes.</span>
<span id="p551" class="sentence">15  And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes, launch your attack, for the true God will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the Phi·lisʹtines.”</span>
<span id="p552" class="sentence">16  So David did just as the true God commanded him, and they struck down the Phi·lisʹtine army from Gibʹe·on to Geʹzer.</span>
<span id="p553" class="sentence">17  And David’s fame spread into all the lands, and Jehovah put the dread of him upon all the nations.</span></p></level1>
