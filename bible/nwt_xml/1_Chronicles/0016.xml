<p><span id="p585" class="sentence">So they brought the Ark of the true God in and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and they presented burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before the true God.</span>
<span id="p586" class="sentence">2  When David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p587" class="sentence">3  Further, he distributed to all the Israelites, to each man and woman, a round loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.</span>
<span id="p588" class="sentence">4  Then he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the Ark of Jehovah, to honor, thank, and praise Jehovah the God of Israel.</span>
<span id="p589" class="sentence">5  Aʹsaph was the head, and second to him was Zech·a·riʹah; and Je·iʹel, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·hiʹel, Mat·ti·thiʹah, E·liʹab, Be·naiʹah, Oʹbed-eʹdom, and Je·iʹel played stringed instruments and harps; and Aʹsaph played the cymbals,</span>
<span id="p590" class="sentence">6  and Be·naiʹah and Ja·ha·ziʹel the priests blew the trumpets constantly before the ark of the covenant of the true God.</span>
<span id="p591" class="sentence">7  It was on that day that David first contributed a song of thanks to Jehovah through Aʹsaph and his brothers:</span>
<span id="p592" class="sentence">8  “Give thanks to Jehovah, call on his name,Make his deeds known among the peoples!</span>
<span id="p593" class="sentence">9  Sing to him, sing praises to him,Ponder over all his wonderful works.</span>
<span id="p594" class="sentence">10  Boast about his holy name.
Let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.</span>
<span id="p595" class="sentence">11  Search for Jehovah and his strength.
Seek his face constantly.</span>
<span id="p596" class="sentence">12  Remember the wonderful works he has performed,His miracles and the judgments he has pronounced,</span>
<span id="p597" class="sentence">13  You offspring of Israel his servant,You sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span>
<span id="p598" class="sentence">14  He is Jehovah our God.
His judgments are throughout the earth.</span>
<span id="p599" class="sentence">15  Remember his covenant forever,The promise he made, to a thousand generations,</span>
<span id="p600" class="sentence">16  The covenant he made with Abraham,And the oath he swore to Isaac,</span>
<span id="p601" class="sentence">17  Which he established as a decree to JacobAnd as a lasting covenant to Israel,</span>
<span id="p602" class="sentence">18  Saying, ‘I will give you the land of CaʹnaanAs your allotted inheritance.’</span>
<span id="p603" class="sentence">19  This was when you were few in number,Yes, very few, and you were foreigners in the land.</span>
<span id="p604" class="sentence">20  They walked about from nation to nation,From one kingdom to another people.</span>
<span id="p605" class="sentence">21  He did not allow any man to oppress them,But on their account he reproved kings,</span>
<span id="p606" class="sentence">22  Saying, ‘Do not touch my anointed ones,And to my prophets do nothing bad.’</span>
<span id="p607" class="sentence">23  Sing to Jehovah, all the earth!
Announce his salvation day after day!</span>
<span id="p608" class="sentence">24  Declare his glory among the nations,His wonderful works among all the peoples.</span>
<span id="p609" class="sentence">25  For Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise.
He is more awe-inspiring than all other gods.</span>
<span id="p610" class="sentence">26  All the gods of the peoples are worthless gods,But Jehovah is the one who made the heavens.</span>
<span id="p611" class="sentence">27  In his presence are majesty and splendor;Strength and joy are in his dwelling place.</span>
<span id="p612" class="sentence">28  Give Jehovah his due, you families of the peoples,Give Jehovah his due for his glory and strength.</span>
<span id="p613" class="sentence">29  Give Jehovah the glory due his name;Bring a gift and come in before him.
Bow down to Jehovah in holy adornment.</span>
<span id="p614" class="sentence">30  Tremble before him, all the earth!
The earth is firmly established; it cannot be moved.</span>
<span id="p615" class="sentence">31  Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be joyful;Declare among the nations: ‘Jehovah has become King!’</span>
<span id="p616" class="sentence">32  Let the sea thunder and all that fills it;Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.</span>
<span id="p617" class="sentence">33  At the same time let the trees of the forest shout joyfully before Jehovah,For he is coming to judge the earth.</span>
<span id="p618" class="sentence">34  Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;His loyal love endures forever.</span>
<span id="p619" class="sentence">35  And say, ‘Save us, O God of our salvation,Gather us and rescue us from the nations,So that we may give thanks to your holy nameAnd exult in praising you.</span>
<span id="p620" class="sentence">36  May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praisedThroughout all eternity.’”
And all the people said, “Amen!” and they praised Jehovah.</span>
<span id="p621" class="sentence">37  Then David left Aʹsaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to minister continually before the Ark, according to the daily routine.</span>
<span id="p622" class="sentence">38  Oʹbed-eʹdom and his brothers, numbering 68, and Oʹbed-eʹdom, the son of Je·duʹthun, and Hoʹsah were gatekeepers;</span>
<span id="p623" class="sentence">39  and Zaʹdok the priest and his fellow priests were before the tabernacle of Jehovah on the high place at Gibʹe·on</span>
<span id="p624" class="sentence">40  to offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah regularly on the altar of burnt offering, morning and evening, and to do all that is written in the Law of Jehovah that he commanded Israel.</span>
<span id="p625" class="sentence">41  With them were Heʹman and Je·duʹthun and the rest of the selected men who were designated by their names to thank Jehovah, because “his loyal love endures forever”;</span>
<span id="p626" class="sentence">42  and with them were Heʹman and Je·duʹthun to sound the trumpets, cymbals, and the instruments used to praise the true God; and the sons of Je·duʹthun were at the gate.</span>
<span id="p627" class="sentence">43  Then all the people went to their homes, and David went to bless his own household.</span></p></level1>
