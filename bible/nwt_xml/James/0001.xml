<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the 12 tribes that are scattered about:
Greetings!</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials,</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith produces endurance.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  But let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  So if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  But let him keep asking in faith, not doubting at all, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  In fact, that man should not expect to receive anything from Jehovah;</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  he is an indecisive man, unsteady in all his ways.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  But let the lowly brother rejoice over his exaltation,</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  and the rich one over his humiliation, because like a flower of the field he will pass away.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  For just as the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the plant, and its flower falls off and its outward beauty perishes, so too the rich man will fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  Happy is the man who keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving Him.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  Do not be misled, my beloved brothers.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the Father of the celestial lights, who does not vary or change like the shifting shadows.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  It was his will to bring us forth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  Know this, my beloved brothers: Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger,</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  for man’s anger does not bring about God’s righteousness.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  Therefore, put away all filthiness and every trace of badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word that is able to save you.</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">22  However, become doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">23  For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">24  For he looks at himself, and he goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he is.</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">25  But the one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">26  If any man thinks he is a worshipper of God but does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he is deceiving his own heart, and his worship is futile.</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">27  The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.</span></p></level1>
