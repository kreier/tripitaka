<p><span id="p57" class="sentence">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">2  For we all stumble many times. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also his whole body.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">3  If we put bridles in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide also their whole body.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">4  Look also at ships: Although they are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">5  So, too, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it makes great brags. See how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze!</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">6  The tongue is also a fire. The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members, for it defiles all the body and sets the whole course of life on fire, and it is set on fire by Ge·henʹna.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">7  For every kind of wild animal and bird and reptile and sea creature is to be tamed and has been tamed by humans.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">8  But no human can tame the tongue. It is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">9  With it we praise Jehovah, the Father, and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence “in the likeness of God.”</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">10  Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing.
My brothers, it is not right for things to happen this way.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">11  A spring does not cause the fresh water and the bitter water to bubble out of the same opening, does it?</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">12  My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, or a grapevine figs, can it? Neither can salt water produce fresh water.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">13  Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed with a mildness that comes from wisdom.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">14  But if you have bitter jealousy and contentiousness in your hearts, do not be bragging and lying against the truth.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">15  This is not the wisdom that comes down from above; it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">16  For wherever there are jealousy and contentiousness, there will also be disorder and every vile thing.</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">17  But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, not hypocritical.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">18  Moreover, the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions for those who are making peace.</span></p></level1>
