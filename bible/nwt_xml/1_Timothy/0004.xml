<p><span id="p56" class="sentence">However, the inspired word clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired statements and teachings of demons,</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">2  by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, whose conscience is seared as with a branding iron.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">3  They forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods that God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">4  For every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">5  for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over it.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">6  By giving this counsel to the brothers, you will be a fine minister of Christ Jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching that you have followed closely.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">7  But reject irreverent false stories, like those told by old women. On the other hand, train yourself with godly devotion as your aim.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">8  For physical training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">9  That statement is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">10  This is why we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">11  Keep on giving these commands and teaching them.</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">12  Never let anyone look down on your youth. Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">13  Until I come, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">14  Do not neglect the gift in you that was given you through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">15  Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">16  Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</span></p></level1>
