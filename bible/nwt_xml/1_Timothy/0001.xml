<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope,</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  to Timothy, a genuine child in the faith:
May you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  Just as I encouraged you to stay in Ephʹe·sus when I was about to go to Mac·e·doʹni·a, so I do now, in order for you to command certain ones not to teach different doctrine,</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies. Such things end up in nothing useful but merely give rise to speculations rather than providing anything from God in connection with faith.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  Really, the objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  By deviating from these things, some have been turned aside to meaningless talk.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  They want to be teachers of law, but they do not understand either the things they are saying or the things they insist on so strongly.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  Now we know that the Law is fine if one applies it properly,</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  recognizing that law is made, not for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, ungodly and sinners, disloyal and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  sexually immoral people, men who practice homosexuality, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and everything else that is in opposition to the wholesome teaching</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  according to the glorious good news of the happy God, with which I was entrusted.</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry,</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Nevertheless, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith.</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these, I am foremost.</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  Nevertheless, I was shown mercy so that by means of me as the foremost case, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his patience, making me an example to those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  This instruction I entrust to you, my child Timothy, in harmony with the prophecies that were made about you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare,</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside, resulting in the shipwreck of their faith.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  Hy·me·naeʹus and Alexander are among these, and I have handed them over to Satan so that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme.</span></p></level1>
