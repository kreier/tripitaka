<p><span id="p23" class="sentence">First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men,</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">2  concerning kings and all those who are in high positions, so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness.</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">3  This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God,</span>
<span id="p26" class="sentence">4  whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.</span>
<span id="p27" class="sentence">5  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus,</span>
<span id="p28" class="sentence">6  who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time.</span>
<span id="p29" class="sentence">7  For the purpose of this witness I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—a teacher of nations in the matter of faith and truth.</span>
<span id="p30" class="sentence">8  So I desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands, without anger and debates.</span>
<span id="p31" class="sentence">9  Likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing,</span>
<span id="p32" class="sentence">10  but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God, namely, through good works.</span>
<span id="p33" class="sentence">11  Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness.</span>
<span id="p34" class="sentence">12  I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but she is to remain silent.</span>
<span id="p35" class="sentence">13  For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</span>
<span id="p36" class="sentence">14  Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and became a transgressor.</span>
<span id="p37" class="sentence">15  However, she will be kept safe through childbearing, provided she continues in faith and love and holiness along with soundness of mind.</span></p></level1>
