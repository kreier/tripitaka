<p><span id="p39" class="sentence">This statement is trustworthy: If a man is reaching out to be an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">2  The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach,</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">3  not a drunkard, not violent, but reasonable, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money,</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">4  a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having his children in subjection with all seriousness</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">5  (for if any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he care for the congregation of God?),</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">6  not a newly converted man, for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the Devil.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">7  Moreover, he should also have a fine testimony from outsiders so that he does not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">8  Ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued, not indulging in a lot of wine, not greedy of dishonest gain,</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">9  holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience.</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">10  Also, let these be tested as to fitness first; then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">11  Women should likewise be serious, not slanderous, moderate in habits, faithful in all things.</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">12  Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households.</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">13  For the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">14  I am writing you these things, though I am hoping to come to you shortly,</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">15  but in case I am delayed, so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">16  Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘He was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, appeared to angels, was preached about among nations, was believed upon in the world, was received up in glory.’</span></p></level1>
