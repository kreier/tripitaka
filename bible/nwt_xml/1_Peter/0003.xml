<level1><h1 id="p53">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p54" class="sentence">In the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives,</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">2  because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect.</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">3  Do not let your adornment be external—the braiding of hair and the wearing of gold ornaments or fine clothing—</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">4  but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">5  For this is how the holy women of the past who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands,</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">6  just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you have become her children, provided you continue doing good and do not give in to fear.</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">7  You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">8  Finally, all of you have unity of mind, fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion, and humility.</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">9  Do not pay back injury for injury or insult for insult. Instead, repay with a blessing, for you were called to this course, so that you might inherit a blessing.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">10  For “whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad and his lips from speaking deception.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">11  Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</span>
<span id="p65" class="sentence">12  For the eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication, but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things.”</span>
<span id="p66" class="sentence">13  Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good?</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">14  But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not fear what they fear, nor be disturbed.</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">15  But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">16  Maintain a good conscience, so that in whatever way you are spoken against, those who speak against you may be put to shame because of your good conduct as followers of Christ.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">17  For it is better to suffer because you are doing good, if it is God’s will to allow it, than because you are doing evil.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">18  For Christ died once for all time for sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, in order to lead you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit.</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">19  And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">20  who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting in Noah’s day, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">21  Baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you (not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request to God for a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">22  He is at God’s right hand, for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.</span></p></level1>
