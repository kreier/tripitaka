<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">A pronouncement that Ha·bakʹkuk the prophet received in a vision:</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, but you do not hear?
How long must I ask for help from violence, but you do not intervene?</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?
And why do you tolerate oppression?
Why are destruction and violence before me?
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  So law is paralyzed,And justice is never carried out.
For the wicked surround the righteous;That is why justice is perverted.</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  “Look among the nations and pay attention!
Stare in amazement and be astounded;For something will happen in your daysThat you will not believe even if it is told to you.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  For here I am raising up the Chal·deʹans,The ruthless and impetuous nation.
They sweep through vast stretches of the earthTo seize homes not theirs.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  They are frightening and fearsome.
They establish their own justice and authority.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  Their horses are swifter than leopards,And they are fiercer than wolves in the night.
Their warhorses gallop forward;Their horses come from far away.
They swoop down like the eagle rushing to feed.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  All of them come bent on violence.
The assembling of their faces is like the east wind,And they scoop up captives like sand.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  They scoff at kingsAnd laugh at high officials.
They laugh at every fortified place;They pile up a dirt ramp and capture it.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  Then they move forward like the wind and pass through,But they will become guilty,Because they credit their power to their god.”</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  Are you not from everlasting, O Jehovah?
O my God, my Holy One, you do not die.
O Jehovah, you appointed them to execute judgment;My Rock, you established them for punishment.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  Your eyes are too pure to look on what is evil,And you cannot tolerate wickedness.
Why, then, do you tolerate the treacherousAnd keep silent when a wicked man swallows up someone more righteous than he is?</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  Why do you make man like the fish of the sea,Like creeping things that have no ruler?</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  All of these he hauls up with a fishhook.
He catches them in his dragnet,And he gathers them in his fishing net.
That is why he rejoices greatly.</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  That is why he offers sacrifices to his dragnetAnd makes sacrifices to his fishing net;For by them his portion is rich,And his food is choice.</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  Will he then keep emptying out his dragnet?
Will he go on slaughtering nations without compassion?</span></p></level1>
