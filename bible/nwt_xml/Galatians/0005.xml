<p><span id="p111" class="sentence">For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore, stand firm, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">2  See! I, Paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">3  Again I bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">4  You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law; you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness.</span>
<span id="p115" class="sentence">5  For our part, we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith.</span>
<span id="p116" class="sentence">6  For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value, but faith operating through love is.</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">7  You were running well. Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">8  This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you.</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">9  A little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">10  I am confident that you who are in union with the Lord will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing you trouble, whoever he may be, will receive the judgment he deserves.</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">11  As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the torture stake has been eliminated.</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">12  I wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves.</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">13  You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires, but through love slave for one another.</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">14  For the entire Law has been fulfilled in one commandment, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">15  If, though, you keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that you do not get annihilated by one another.</span>
<span id="p126" class="sentence">16  But I say, Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.</span>
<span id="p127" class="sentence">17  For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do the very things you want to do.</span>
<span id="p128" class="sentence">18  Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law.</span>
<span id="p129" class="sentence">19  Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct,</span>
<span id="p130" class="sentence">20  idolatry, spiritism, hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects,</span>
<span id="p131" class="sentence">21  envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these. I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.</span>
<span id="p132" class="sentence">22  On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">23  mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">24  Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires.</span>
<span id="p135" class="sentence">25  If we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit.</span>
<span id="p136" class="sentence">26  Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.</span></p></level1>
