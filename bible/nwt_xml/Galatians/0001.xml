<level1><h1 id="p1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p><span id="p2" class="sentence">Paul, an apostle, neither from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from the dead,</span>
<span id="p3" class="sentence">2  and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Ga·laʹti·a:</span>
<span id="p4" class="sentence">3  May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p5" class="sentence">4  He gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue us from the present wicked system of things according to the will of our God and Father,</span>
<span id="p6" class="sentence">5  to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
<span id="p7" class="sentence">6  I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from the One who called you with Christ’s undeserved kindness to another sort of good news.</span>
<span id="p8" class="sentence">7  Not that there is another good news; but there are certain ones who are causing you trouble and wanting to distort the good news about the Christ.</span>
<span id="p9" class="sentence">8  However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond the good news we declared to you, let him be accursed.</span>
<span id="p10" class="sentence">9  As we have said before, I now say again, Whoever is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted, let him be accursed.</span>
<span id="p11" class="sentence">10  Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be Christ’s slave.</span>
<span id="p12" class="sentence">11  For I want you to know, brothers, that the good news I declared to you is not of human origin;</span>
<span id="p13" class="sentence">12  for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through a revelation by Jesus Christ.</span>
<span id="p14" class="sentence">13  Of course, you heard about my conduct formerly in Juʹda·ism, that I kept intensely persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it;</span>
<span id="p15" class="sentence">14  and I was making greater progress in Juʹda·ism than many of my own age in my nation, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span>
<span id="p16" class="sentence">15  But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness, thought good</span>
<span id="p17" class="sentence">16  to reveal his Son through me so that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, I did not immediately consult with any human;</span>
<span id="p18" class="sentence">17  nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was, but I went to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus.</span>
<span id="p19" class="sentence">18  Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to visit Ceʹphas, and I stayed with him for 15 days.</span>
<span id="p20" class="sentence">19  But I did not see any of the other apostles, only James the brother of the Lord.</span>
<span id="p21" class="sentence">20  Now regarding the things I am writing you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.</span>
<span id="p22" class="sentence">21  After that I went into the regions of Syria and Ci·liʹcia.</span>
<span id="p23" class="sentence">22  But I was personally unknown to the congregations of Ju·deʹa that were in union with Christ.</span>
<span id="p24" class="sentence">23  They only used to hear: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated.”</span>
<span id="p25" class="sentence">24  So they began glorifying God because of me.</span></p></level1>
