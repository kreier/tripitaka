<level1><h1 id="p692">Chapter 29</h1>
<p><span id="p693" class="sentence">Job continued his discourse, saying:</span>
<span id="p694" class="sentence">2  “If only I were in the months gone by,In the days when God was watching over me,</span>
<span id="p695" class="sentence">3  When he caused his lamp to shine upon my head,When I walked through darkness by his light,</span>
<span id="p696" class="sentence">4  When I was in my prime,When God’s friendship was felt in my tent,</span>
<span id="p697" class="sentence">5  When the Almighty was still with me,When my children were all around me,</span>
<span id="p698" class="sentence">6  When my steps were awash in butter,And the rocks poured out streams of oil for me.</span>
<span id="p699" class="sentence">7  When I used to go out to the city gateAnd take my seat in the public square,</span>
<span id="p700" class="sentence">8  The young men would see me and step aside,And even the old men would rise and remain standing.</span>
<span id="p701" class="sentence">9  Princes refrained from speaking;They would put their hand over their mouth.</span>
<span id="p702" class="sentence">10  The voices of the prominent men were silenced;Their tongue was stuck to the roof of their mouth.</span>
<span id="p703" class="sentence">11  Whoever heard me would speak well of me,And those who saw me would testify for me.</span>
<span id="p704" class="sentence">12  For I would rescue the poor who cried for help,Along with the fatherless child and anyone who had no helper.</span>
<span id="p705" class="sentence">13  The one about to perish would bless me,And I made the heart of the widow rejoice.</span>
<span id="p706" class="sentence">14  I put on righteousness as my clothing;My justice was like a robe and a turban.</span>
<span id="p707" class="sentence">15  I became eyes to the blindAnd feet to the lame.</span>
<span id="p708" class="sentence">16  I was a father to the poor;I would investigate the legal case of those I did not know.</span>
<span id="p709" class="sentence">17  I would break the jaws of the wrongdoerAnd tear the prey away from his teeth.</span>
<span id="p710" class="sentence">18  I used to say, ‘I will die in my own home,And my days will be as numerous as the grains of sand.</span>
<span id="p711" class="sentence">19  My roots will spread out into the waters,And dew will stay all night on my branches.</span>
<span id="p712" class="sentence">20  My glory is constantly renewed,And the bow in my hand will keep shooting.’</span>
<span id="p713" class="sentence">21  People would listen expectantly,Waiting in silence for my advice.</span>
<span id="p714" class="sentence">22  After I had spoken, they had nothing more to say;My words would fall gently on their ears.</span>
<span id="p715" class="sentence">23  They waited for me as for the rain;They opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.</span>
<span id="p716" class="sentence">24  When I smiled at them, they could hardly believe it;The light of my face would reassure them.</span>
<span id="p717" class="sentence">25  I gave them direction as their head,And I lived like a king among his troops,Like one who comforts the mourners.</span></p></level1>
