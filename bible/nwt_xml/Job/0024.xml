<p><span id="p592" class="sentence">“Why does the Almighty not set a time?
Why do those who know him not see his day?</span>
<span id="p593" class="sentence">2  People move boundary markers;They carry off flocks for their own pasture.</span>
<span id="p594" class="sentence">3  They drive away the donkey of fatherless childrenAnd seize the widow’s bull as security for a loan.</span>
<span id="p595" class="sentence">4  They force the poor off the road;The helpless of the earth must hide from them.</span>
<span id="p596" class="sentence">5  The poor forage for food like wild donkeys in the wilderness;They seek food in the desert for their children.</span>
<span id="p597" class="sentence">6  They must harvest in another’s fieldAnd glean from the vineyard of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p598" class="sentence">7  They spend the night naked, without clothing;They have no covering for the cold.</span>
<span id="p599" class="sentence">8  They are drenched by the mountain rains;They cling to the rocks for lack of shelter.</span>
<span id="p600" class="sentence">9  The fatherless child is snatched away from the breast;And the garments of the poor are taken as security for a loan,</span>
<span id="p601" class="sentence">10  Forcing them to go about naked, without clothing,And hungry, as they carry the sheaves of grain.</span>
<span id="p602" class="sentence">11  They toil among the terrace walls in the heat of the day;They tread the winepresses, yet they go thirsty.</span>
<span id="p603" class="sentence">12  The dying keep groaning in the city;The fatally wounded cry for help,But God does not regard this as improper.</span>
<span id="p604" class="sentence">13  There are those who rebel against light;They do not recognize its ways,And they do not follow its paths.</span>
<span id="p605" class="sentence">14  The murderer rises at daybreak;He slays the helpless and the poor,While at night he engages in theft.</span>
<span id="p606" class="sentence">15  The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,Saying, ‘No one will see me!’
And he covers his face.</span>
<span id="p607" class="sentence">16  In the darkness they break into houses;By day they shut themselves in.
They are strangers to the light.</span>
<span id="p608" class="sentence">17  For morning is the same as deep darkness for them;They are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness.</span>
<span id="p609" class="sentence">18  But they are swiftly carried away by the waters.
Their portion of the land will be cursed.
They will not return to their vineyards.</span>
<span id="p610" class="sentence">19  Just as drought and heat take away the melted snow,The Grave takes away those who have sinned!</span>
<span id="p611" class="sentence">20  His mother will forget him; the maggot will feast on him.
He will be remembered no more.
And unrighteousness will be broken just like a tree.</span>
<span id="p612" class="sentence">21  He preys on the barren woman,And mistreats the widow.</span>
<span id="p613" class="sentence">22  God will use his strength to do away with the powerful;Though they may rise up, they have no assurance of life.</span>
<span id="p614" class="sentence">23  God lets them become confident and secure,But his eyes are on everything they do.</span>
<span id="p615" class="sentence">24  They are exalted for a little while, then they are no more.
They are brought low and gathered like everyone else;They are cut off like heads of grain.</span>
<span id="p616" class="sentence">25  Now who can prove me a liarOr refute my word?”</span></p></level1>
