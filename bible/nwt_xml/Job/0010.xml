<p><span id="p228" class="sentence">“I loathe my life.
I will give vent to my complaints.
I will speak out in my bitter distress!</span>
<span id="p229" class="sentence">2  I will say to God: ‘Do not pronounce me guilty.
Tell me why you are contending with me.</span>
<span id="p230" class="sentence">3  Does it benefit you to oppress,To despise the work of your handsWhile you favor the advice of the wicked?</span>
<span id="p231" class="sentence">4  Do you have eyes of flesh,Or do you see as mortal man does?</span>
<span id="p232" class="sentence">5  Are your days like the days of mortals,Or are your years like those of a man,</span>
<span id="p233" class="sentence">6  That you should search out my errorAnd keep looking for my sin?</span>
<span id="p234" class="sentence">7  You know that I am not guilty;And no one can save me from your hand.</span>
<span id="p235" class="sentence">8  Your own hands have shaped me and made me,But now you would completely destroy me.</span>
<span id="p236" class="sentence">9  Remember, please, that you made me out of clay,But now you make me return to dust.</span>
<span id="p237" class="sentence">10  Did you not pour me out like milkAnd curdle me like cheese?</span>
<span id="p238" class="sentence">11  With skin and flesh you clothed me,And with bones and sinews you wove me together.</span>
<span id="p239" class="sentence">12  You have given me life and loyal love;You have guarded my spirit with your care.</span>
<span id="p240" class="sentence">13  But you secretly intended to do these things.
I know that these things are from you.</span>
<span id="p241" class="sentence">14  If I sinned, you would watch me,And you would not acquit me of my error.</span>
<span id="p242" class="sentence">15  If I am guilty, too bad for me!
And even if I am innocent, I cannot raise my head,For I am filled with dishonor and affliction.</span>
<span id="p243" class="sentence">16  If I raise my head up, you hunt for me like a lionAnd again show your power against me.</span>
<span id="p244" class="sentence">17  You bring new witnesses against meAnd increase your anger against me,As hardship after hardship comes upon me.</span>
<span id="p245" class="sentence">18  So why did you bring me out from the womb?
I should have died before any eye could see me.</span>
<span id="p246" class="sentence">19  It would have been as though I never existed;I would have been taken straight from the womb to the grave.’</span>
<span id="p247" class="sentence">20  Are not my days few? Let him leave me alone;Let him turn his eyes away from me, so that I may find some relief</span>
<span id="p248" class="sentence">21  Before I go away—and I will not return—To the land of deepest darkness,</span>
<span id="p249" class="sentence">22  To the land of utter gloom,A land of deep shadow and disorder,Where even the light is like the gloom.”</span></p></level1>
