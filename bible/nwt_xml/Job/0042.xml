<p><span id="p1096" class="sentence">Then Job said in reply to Jehovah:</span>
<span id="p1097" class="sentence">2  “Now I know that you are able to do all thingsAnd that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you.</span>
<span id="p1098" class="sentence">3  You said, ‘Who is this who is obscuring my counsel without knowledge?’
Therefore I spoke, but without understandingAbout things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.</span>
<span id="p1099" class="sentence">4  You said, ‘Please listen, and I will speak.
I will question you, and you inform me.’</span>
<span id="p1100" class="sentence">5  My ears have heard about you,But now I do see you with my eyes.</span>
<span id="p1101" class="sentence">6  That is why I take back what I said,And I repent in dust and ashes.”</span>
<span id="p1102" class="sentence">7  After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite:
“My anger burns against you and your two companions, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.</span>
<span id="p1103" class="sentence">8  Now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt sacrifice for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you. I will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.”</span>
<span id="p1104" class="sentence">9  So Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite, Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite, and Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite went and did what Jehovah had told them to do. And Jehovah accepted Job’s prayer.</span>
<span id="p1105" class="sentence">10  After Job had prayed for his companions, Jehovah removed Job’s tribulation and restored his prosperity. Jehovah gave him double what he had before.</span>
<span id="p1106" class="sentence">11  All his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and ate a meal with him in his house. They sympathized with him and comforted him over all the calamity that Jehovah had allowed to come upon him. Each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.</span>
<span id="p1107" class="sentence">12  So Jehovah blessed the last part of Job’s life more than the beginning, and Job came to have 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 pairs of cattle, and 1,000 female donkeys.</span>
<span id="p1108" class="sentence">13  He also came to have seven more sons and three more daughters.</span>
<span id="p1109" class="sentence">14  He named the first daughter Je·miʹmah, the second Ke·ziʹah, and the third Kerʹen-hapʹpuch.</span>
<span id="p1110" class="sentence">15  No women in all the land were as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.</span>
<span id="p1111" class="sentence">16  After this Job lived for 140 years, and he saw his children and his grandchildren—four generations.</span>
<span id="p1112" class="sentence">17  Finally Job died, after a long and satisfying life.</span></p></level1>
