<p><span id="p169" class="sentence">Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite then said in reply:</span>
<span id="p170" class="sentence">2  “How long will you keep speaking like this?
The words of your mouth are but a mighty wind!</span>
<span id="p171" class="sentence">3  Will God pervert justice,Or will the Almighty pervert righteousness?</span>
<span id="p172" class="sentence">4  If your sons sinned against him,He let them be punished for their revolt;</span>
<span id="p173" class="sentence">5  But if you would just look to GodAnd plead with the Almighty for favor,</span>
<span id="p174" class="sentence">6  And if you were truly pure and upright,He would pay attention to youAnd restore you to your rightful place.</span>
<span id="p175" class="sentence">7  And though your beginning was small,Your future would be great.</span>
<span id="p176" class="sentence">8  Ask, please, the former generation,And pay attention to the things their fathers found out.</span>
<span id="p177" class="sentence">9  For we were born only yesterday, and we know nothing,Because our days on earth are a shadow.</span>
<span id="p178" class="sentence">10  Will they not instruct youAnd tell you what they know?</span>
<span id="p179" class="sentence">11  Will a papyrus plant grow tall where there is no marsh?
Will a reed grow tall without water?</span>
<span id="p180" class="sentence">12  While it is still in the bud, not yet plucked off,It will dry up before any other plant.</span>
<span id="p181" class="sentence">13  This is the outcome of all who forget God,For the hope of the godless will perish,</span>
<span id="p182" class="sentence">14  Whose confidence is in vainAnd whose trust is as fragile as a spider’s web.</span>
<span id="p183" class="sentence">15  He will lean against his house, but it will not keep standing;He will try to hold on to it, but it will not last.</span>
<span id="p184" class="sentence">16  He is a moist plant in the sunlight,And his shoots spread out in the garden.</span>
<span id="p185" class="sentence">17  In a heap of stones, his roots become entwined;He looks for a house among the stones.</span>
<span id="p186" class="sentence">18  But when he is uprooted from his place,That place will deny him and say, ‘I have never seen you.’</span>
<span id="p187" class="sentence">19  Yes, that is how he will disappear;Then others will spring up from the dust.</span>
<span id="p188" class="sentence">20  Surely God will not reject those who keep integrity;Nor will he support evil men,</span>
<span id="p189" class="sentence">21  For he will yet fill your mouth with laughterAnd your lips with shouts of joy.</span>
<span id="p190" class="sentence">22  Those hating you will be clothed with shame,And the tent of wicked ones will be no more.”</span></p></level1>
