<p><span id="p640" class="sentence">Job continued his discourse, saying:</span>
<span id="p641" class="sentence">2  “As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice,As the Almighty lives, who has made me bitter,</span>
<span id="p642" class="sentence">3  As long as my breath is within meAnd spirit from God is in my nostrils,</span>
<span id="p643" class="sentence">4  My lips will not speak unrighteousness;Nor will my tongue mutter deceit!</span>
<span id="p644" class="sentence">5  It is unthinkable for me to declare you men righteous!
Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity!</span>
<span id="p645" class="sentence">6  I will maintain my righteousness and never let it go;My heart will not condemn me as long as I live.</span>
<span id="p646" class="sentence">7  May my enemy become like the wicked,Those assaulting me like the unrighteous.</span>
<span id="p647" class="sentence">8  For what hope does the godless man have when he is destroyed,When God takes away his life?</span>
<span id="p648" class="sentence">9  Will God hear his outcryWhen distress comes upon him?</span>
<span id="p649" class="sentence">10  Or will he find delight in the Almighty?
Will he call on God at all times?</span>
<span id="p650" class="sentence">11  I will teach you about the power of God;I will not hide anything about the Almighty.</span>
<span id="p651" class="sentence">12  Look! If you have all seen visions,Why are your speeches completely empty?</span>
<span id="p652" class="sentence">13  This is the wicked man’s share from God,The inheritance that tyrants receive from the Almighty.</span>
<span id="p653" class="sentence">14  If his sons become many, they will fall by the sword,And his descendants will not have enough food.</span>
<span id="p654" class="sentence">15  Those who survive him will be buried by the plague,And their widows will not weep for them.</span>
<span id="p655" class="sentence">16  Even if he piles up silver like the dustAnd stores up fine clothing like the clay,</span>
<span id="p656" class="sentence">17  Though he may gather it,The righteous man will wear it,And the innocent will divide up his silver.</span>
<span id="p657" class="sentence">18  The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon,Like a shelter made by a watchman.</span>
<span id="p658" class="sentence">19  He will go to bed rich but will gather nothing;When he opens his eyes, nothing will be there.</span>
<span id="p659" class="sentence">20  Terror overtakes him like a flood;A storm snatches him away by night.</span>
<span id="p660" class="sentence">21  An east wind will carry him off, and he will be gone;It sweeps him away from his place.</span>
<span id="p661" class="sentence">22  It will hurl itself at him without pityAs he desperately tries to flee from its force.</span>
<span id="p662" class="sentence">23  It claps its hands at himAnd whistles at him from its place.</span></p></level1>
