<level1><h1 id="p937">Chapter 37</h1>
<p><span id="p938" class="sentence">“At this my heart poundsAnd leaps from its place.</span>
<span id="p939" class="sentence">2  Listen carefully to the rumbling of his voiceAnd the thunder that comes from his mouth.</span>
<span id="p940" class="sentence">3  He unleashes it under the entire heavensAnd sends his lightning to the ends of the earth.</span>
<span id="p941" class="sentence">4  After that is a roaring sound;He thunders with a majestic voice,And he does not hold it back when his voice is heard.</span>
<span id="p942" class="sentence">5  God thunders with his voice in a wonderful way;He does great things that are beyond our understanding.</span>
<span id="p943" class="sentence">6  For he says to the snow, ‘Fall to the earth,’
And to the downpour of rain, ‘Pour down mightily.’</span>
<span id="p944" class="sentence">7  God puts a stop to all human activitySo that every mortal man will know His work.</span>
<span id="p945" class="sentence">8  The wild animals go into their densAnd remain in their lairs.</span>
<span id="p946" class="sentence">9  The storm wind blows from its chamber,And the cold comes from the north winds.</span>
<span id="p947" class="sentence">10  By the breath of God, the ice is produced,And the broad waters are frozen solid.</span>
<span id="p948" class="sentence">11  Yes, he weighs down the clouds with moisture;He scatters his lightning in the clouds;</span>
<span id="p949" class="sentence">12  They swirl around where he directs them;They carry out whatever he commands on the surface of the inhabited earth.</span>
<span id="p950" class="sentence">13  Whether it is for punishment or for the sake of the landOr for loyal love, he causes it to happen.</span>
<span id="p951" class="sentence">14  Listen to this, Job;Stop and consider carefully the wonderful works of God.</span>
<span id="p952" class="sentence">15  Do you know how God controls the cloudsAnd how he causes the lightning to flash from his cloud?</span>
<span id="p953" class="sentence">16  Do you know how the clouds float?
These are the wonderful works of the One perfect in knowledge.</span>
<span id="p954" class="sentence">17  Why does your clothing become hotWhen the earth is still because of the south wind?</span>
<span id="p955" class="sentence">18  Can you, with him, spread out the skiesAs solid as a metal mirror?</span>
<span id="p956" class="sentence">19  Tell us what we should say to him;We cannot answer because we are in the dark.</span>
<span id="p957" class="sentence">20  Should he be told that I want to speak?
Or has anyone said something that should be communicated to him?</span>
<span id="p958" class="sentence">21  They cannot even see the light,Though it is bright in the sky,Until a wind passes by and clears away the clouds.</span>
<span id="p959" class="sentence">22  Out of the north comes golden splendor;God’s majesty is awe-inspiring.</span>
<span id="p960" class="sentence">23  Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach;He is great in power,And he never violates his justice and abundant righteousness.</span>
<span id="p961" class="sentence">24  Therefore, people should fear him.
For he does not favor any who think that they are wise.”</span></p></level1>
