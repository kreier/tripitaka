<p><span id="p386" class="sentence">Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p387" class="sentence">2  “I have heard many things like these before.
All of you are troublesome comforters!</span>
<span id="p388" class="sentence">3  Is there an end to empty words?
What provokes you to answer this way?</span>
<span id="p389" class="sentence">4  I could also speak as you do.
If you were in my place,I could make persuasive speeches against youAnd shake my head at you.</span>
<span id="p390" class="sentence">5  Instead, though, I would strengthen you with the words of my mouth,And the consolation of my lips would bring relief.</span>
<span id="p391" class="sentence">6  If I speak, my own pain is not relieved,And if I stop speaking, how much is my pain reduced?</span>
<span id="p392" class="sentence">7  But now he has made me weary;He has devastated my whole household.</span>
<span id="p393" class="sentence">8  You also seize me, and it has become a witness,So that my own skinniness rises up and testifies to my face.</span>
<span id="p394" class="sentence">9  His anger has torn me to pieces, and he harbors animosity against me.
He grinds his teeth against me.
My adversary pierces me with his eyes.</span>
<span id="p395" class="sentence">10  They have opened their mouth wide against me,And they have scornfully struck my cheeks;In large numbers they gather against me.</span>
<span id="p396" class="sentence">11  God hands me over to young boys,And he thrusts me into the hands of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p397" class="sentence">12  I was untroubled, but he shattered me;He grabbed me by the back of the neck and crushed me;Then he set me up as his target.</span>
<span id="p398" class="sentence">13  His archers surround me;He pierces my kidneys and feels no compassion;He pours out my gall on the earth.</span>
<span id="p399" class="sentence">14  He breaks through against me with breach after breach;He rushes at me like a warrior.</span>
<span id="p400" class="sentence">15  I have sewn sackcloth together to cover my skin,And I have buried my dignity in the dust.</span>
<span id="p401" class="sentence">16  My face is red from weeping,And on my eyelids is deep shadow,</span>
<span id="p402" class="sentence">17  Although my hands have done no violenceAnd my prayer is pure.</span>
<span id="p403" class="sentence">18  O earth, do not cover my blood!
And let there be no resting-place for my outcry!</span>
<span id="p404" class="sentence">19  Even now, my witness is in the heavens;The one who can testify for me is in the heights.</span>
<span id="p405" class="sentence">20  My companions ridicule meAs my eye sheds tears to God.</span>
<span id="p406" class="sentence">21  Let someone arbitrate between a man and God,As one would between a man and his fellow.</span>
<span id="p407" class="sentence">22  For the years to come are few,And I will go away on the path of no return.</span></p></level1>
