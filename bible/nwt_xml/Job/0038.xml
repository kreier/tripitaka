<level1><h1 id="p962">Chapter 38</h1>
<p><span id="p963" class="sentence">Then Jehovah answered Job out of the windstorm:</span>
<span id="p964" class="sentence">2  “Who is this who is obscuring my counselAnd speaking without knowledge?</span>
<span id="p965" class="sentence">3  Brace yourself, please, like a man;I will question you, and you inform me.</span>
<span id="p966" class="sentence">4  Where were you when I founded the earth?
Tell me, if you think you understand.</span>
<span id="p967" class="sentence">5  Who set its measurements, in case you know,Or who stretched a measuring line across it?</span>
<span id="p968" class="sentence">6  Into what were its pedestals sunk,Or who laid its cornerstone,</span>
<span id="p969" class="sentence">7  When the morning stars joyfully cried out together,And all the sons of God began shouting in applause?</span>
<span id="p970" class="sentence">8  And who barricaded the sea behind doorsWhen it burst out from the womb,</span>
<span id="p971" class="sentence">9  When I clothed it with cloudsAnd wrapped it in thick gloom,</span>
<span id="p972" class="sentence">10  When I established my limit for itAnd put its bars and doors in place,</span>
<span id="p973" class="sentence">11  And I said, ‘You may come this far, and no farther;Here is where your proud waves will stop’?</span>
<span id="p974" class="sentence">12  Have you ever commanded the morningOr made the dawn know its place,</span>
<span id="p975" class="sentence">13  To take hold of the ends of the earthAnd to shake the wicked out of it?</span>
<span id="p976" class="sentence">14  It is transformed like clay under a seal,And its features stand out like those of a garment.</span>
<span id="p977" class="sentence">15  But the light of the wicked is held back from them,And their uplifted arm is broken.</span>
<span id="p978" class="sentence">16  Have you gone down to the sources of the seaOr explored the deep waters?</span>
<span id="p979" class="sentence">17  Have the gates of death been revealed to you,Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?</span>
<span id="p980" class="sentence">18  Have you understood the vast expanse of the earth?
Tell me, if you know all of this.</span>
<span id="p981" class="sentence">19  In which direction does the light reside?
And where is the place of darkness,</span>
<span id="p982" class="sentence">20  That you should take it to its territoryAnd understand the paths to its home?</span>
<span id="p983" class="sentence">21  Do you know this because you were already bornAnd the number of your years is great?</span>
<span id="p984" class="sentence">22  Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,</span>
<span id="p985" class="sentence">23  Which I have reserved for the time of distress,For the day of battle and war?</span>
<span id="p986" class="sentence">24  From what direction is light dispersed,And from where does the east wind blow on the earth?</span>
<span id="p987" class="sentence">25  Who has cut a channel for the floodAnd made a path for the thunderous storm cloud,</span>
<span id="p988" class="sentence">26  To make it rain where no man lives,On the wilderness where there are no humans,</span>
<span id="p989" class="sentence">27  To satisfy devastated wastelandsAnd cause the grass to sprout?</span>
<span id="p990" class="sentence">28  Does the rain have a father,Or who fathered the dewdrops?</span>
<span id="p991" class="sentence">29  From whose womb did the ice emerge,And who gave birth to the frost of heaven</span>
<span id="p992" class="sentence">30  When the waters are covered as if with stone,And the surface of the deep waters is frozen solid?</span>
<span id="p993" class="sentence">31  Can you tie the ropes of the Kiʹmah constellationOr untie the cords of the Keʹsil constellation?</span>
<span id="p994" class="sentence">32  Can you lead out a constellation in its seasonOr guide the Ash constellation along with its sons?</span>
<span id="p995" class="sentence">33  Do you know the laws governing the heavens,Or can you impose their authority on the earth?</span>
<span id="p996" class="sentence">34  Can you raise your voice to the cloudsTo cause a flood of water to cover you?</span>
<span id="p997" class="sentence">35  Can you send out lightning bolts?
Will they come and say to you, ‘Here we are!’</span>
<span id="p998" class="sentence">36  Who put wisdom within the cloudsOr gave understanding to the sky phenomenon?</span>
<span id="p999" class="sentence">37  Who is wise enough to count the clouds,Or who can tip over the water jars of heaven</span>
<span id="p1000" class="sentence">38  When the dust pours into a massAnd the clods of earth stick together?</span>
<span id="p1001" class="sentence">39  Can you hunt prey for a lionOr satisfy the appetites of young lions</span>
<span id="p1002" class="sentence">40  When they crouch in their lairsOr lie in ambush in their dens?</span>
<span id="p1003" class="sentence">41  Who prepares food for the ravenWhen its young cry to God for helpAnd wander about because there is nothing to eat?</span></p></level1>
