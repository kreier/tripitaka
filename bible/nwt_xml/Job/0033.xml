<level1><h1 id="p814">Chapter 33</h1>
<p><span id="p815" class="sentence">“But now, Job, please hear my words;Listen to everything I say.</span>
<span id="p816" class="sentence">2  Look, please! I must open my mouth;My tongue must speak.</span>
<span id="p817" class="sentence">3  My words declare the uprightness of my heart,And my lips sincerely tell what I know.</span>
<span id="p818" class="sentence">4  God’s own spirit made me,And the Almighty’s own breath brought me to life.</span>
<span id="p819" class="sentence">5  Reply to me if you are able;Present your arguments before me; take your position.</span>
<span id="p820" class="sentence">6  Look! I am just like you before the true God;From the clay I too was shaped.</span>
<span id="p821" class="sentence">7  So no fear of me should terrify you,And no pressure from me should overwhelm you.</span>
<span id="p822" class="sentence">8  But you said in my hearing,Yes, I kept hearing these words,</span>
<span id="p823" class="sentence">9  ‘I am pure, without transgression;I am clean, without error.</span>
<span id="p824" class="sentence">10  But God finds reasons to oppose me;He considers me his enemy.</span>
<span id="p825" class="sentence">11  He puts my feet in stocks;He scrutinizes all my paths.’</span>
<span id="p826" class="sentence">12  But you are not right in saying this, so I will answer you:
God is far greater than mortal man.</span>
<span id="p827" class="sentence">13  Why do you complain against Him?
Is it because he did not answer all your words?</span>
<span id="p828" class="sentence">14  For God speaks once and a second time,But no one pays attention,</span>
<span id="p829" class="sentence">15  In a dream, a vision of the night,When deep sleep falls upon peopleWhile they sleep in their beds.</span>
<span id="p830" class="sentence">16  Then he uncovers their earsAnd impresses his instruction upon them,</span>
<span id="p831" class="sentence">17  To turn a person away from wrongdoingAnd to protect a man from pride.</span>
<span id="p832" class="sentence">18  God spares his soul from the pit,His life from perishing by the sword.</span>
<span id="p833" class="sentence">19  A person is also reproved by pain on his bedAnd by the constant distress of his bones,</span>
<span id="p834" class="sentence">20  So that his very being loathes bread,And he rejects even fine food.</span>
<span id="p835" class="sentence">21  His flesh wastes away from sight,And his bones that were hidden now protrude.</span>
<span id="p836" class="sentence">22  His soul draws near to the pit;His life to those who bring death.</span>
<span id="p837" class="sentence">23  If there is a messenger for him,One advocate out of a thousand,To tell to man what is upright,</span>
<span id="p838" class="sentence">24  Then God shows him favor and says,‘Spare him from going down into the pit!
I have found a ransom!</span>
<span id="p839" class="sentence">25  Let his flesh become fresher than in youth;Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.’</span>
<span id="p840" class="sentence">26  He will entreat God, who will accept him,And he will see His face with shouts of joy,And He will restore His righteousness to mortal man.</span>
<span id="p841" class="sentence">27  That person will declare to men,‘I have sinned and distorted what is right,But I did not receive what I deserved.</span>
<span id="p842" class="sentence">28  He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit,And my life will see the light.’</span>
<span id="p843" class="sentence">29  Indeed, God does all these thingsTwice, three times, for a man,</span>
<span id="p844" class="sentence">30  To bring him back from the pit,So that he may be enlightened with the light of life.</span>
<span id="p845" class="sentence">31  Pay attention, Job! Listen to me!
Keep silent, and I will continue speaking.</span>
<span id="p846" class="sentence">32  If you have something to say, reply to me.
Speak, for I want to prove you right.</span>
<span id="p847" class="sentence">33  If you have nothing to say, you should listen to me;Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”</span></p></level1>
