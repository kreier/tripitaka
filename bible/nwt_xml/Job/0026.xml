<p><span id="p625" class="sentence">Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p626" class="sentence">2  “How you have helped the one with no power!
How you have saved the arm that has no strength!</span>
<span id="p627" class="sentence">3  What great advice you have given to the one lacking wisdom!
How freely you have revealed your practical wisdom!</span>
<span id="p628" class="sentence">4  To whom are you trying to speak,And who inspired you to say such things?</span>
<span id="p629" class="sentence">5  Those who are powerless in death tremble;They are even lower than the waters and their inhabitants.</span>
<span id="p630" class="sentence">6  The Grave is naked in front of God,And the place of destruction lies uncovered.</span>
<span id="p631" class="sentence">7  He stretches out the northern sky over empty space,Suspending the earth upon nothing;</span>
<span id="p632" class="sentence">8  He wraps up the waters in his clouds,So that the clouds do not burst under their weight;</span>
<span id="p633" class="sentence">9  He shuts off the view of his throne,Spreading out his cloud over it.</span>
<span id="p634" class="sentence">10  He marks out the horizon on the surface of the waters;He makes a boundary between light and darkness.</span>
<span id="p635" class="sentence">11  The very pillars of heaven shake;They are stunned by his rebuke.</span>
<span id="p636" class="sentence">12  He stirs up the sea with his power,And by his understanding he breaks the sea monster to pieces.</span>
<span id="p637" class="sentence">13  With his breath he makes the skies clear;His hand pierces the elusive serpent.</span>
<span id="p638" class="sentence">14  Look! These are just the fringes of his ways;Only a faint whisper has been heard of him!
So who can understand his mighty thunder?”</span></p></level1>
