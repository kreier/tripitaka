<p><span id="p478" class="sentence">Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite said in reply:</span>
<span id="p479" class="sentence">2  “This is why my own troubling thoughts urge me to answerBecause of the agitation I feel.</span>
<span id="p480" class="sentence">3  I have heard a reproof that insults me;And my understanding impels me to reply.</span>
<span id="p481" class="sentence">4  Surely you must have always known this,For it has been so since man was put on the earth,</span>
<span id="p482" class="sentence">5  That the joyful cry of the wicked is briefAnd the rejoicing of the godless one is for a moment.</span>
<span id="p483" class="sentence">6  Although his greatness ascends to heavenAnd his head reaches to the clouds,</span>
<span id="p484" class="sentence">7  He will perish forever like his own dung;Those who used to see him will say, ‘Where is he?’</span>
<span id="p485" class="sentence">8  He will fly off like a dream, and they will not find him;He will be chased away like a vision of the night.</span>
<span id="p486" class="sentence">9  The eye that once saw him will not do so again,And his place will behold him no more.</span>
<span id="p487" class="sentence">10  His own children will seek the favor of the poor,And his own hands will give back his wealth.</span>
<span id="p488" class="sentence">11  His bones were full of youthful vigor,But it will lie down with him in mere dust.</span>
<span id="p489" class="sentence">12  If what is bad tastes sweet in his mouth,If he hides it under his tongue,</span>
<span id="p490" class="sentence">13  If he savors it and does not let it goBut keeps holding it in his mouth,</span>
<span id="p491" class="sentence">14  His food will turn sour inside him;It will become like the poison of cobras within him.</span>
<span id="p492" class="sentence">15  He has swallowed down wealth, but he will vomit it up;God will empty it out of his belly.</span>
<span id="p493" class="sentence">16  The venom of cobras he will suck;The fangs of a viper will kill him.</span>
<span id="p494" class="sentence">17  He will never see the streams of water,The torrents of honey and butter.</span>
<span id="p495" class="sentence">18  He will give back his goods without consuming them;He will not enjoy the wealth from his trade.</span>
<span id="p496" class="sentence">19  For he has crushed and abandoned the poor;He has seized a house that he did not build.</span>
<span id="p497" class="sentence">20  But he will feel no peace within himself;His wealth will not help him escape.</span>
<span id="p498" class="sentence">21  There is nothing left for him to devour;That is why his prosperity will not last.</span>
<span id="p499" class="sentence">22  When his wealth reaches its peak, anxiety will overtake him;The full force of misfortune will come against him.</span>
<span id="p500" class="sentence">23  As he fills his belly,God will send his burning anger upon him,Raining it down upon him into his bowels.</span>
<span id="p501" class="sentence">24  When he flees from weapons of iron,Arrows from a copper bow will pierce him.</span>
<span id="p502" class="sentence">25  He pulls an arrow from his back,A glittering weapon from his gall,And terror seizes him.</span>
<span id="p503" class="sentence">26  Total darkness awaits his treasures;A fire that no one fanned will consume him;Calamity awaits any survivors in his tent.</span>
<span id="p504" class="sentence">27  Heaven will uncover his error;The earth will rise up against him.</span>
<span id="p505" class="sentence">28  A flood will sweep his house away;It will be a heavy torrent on the day of God’s anger.</span>
<span id="p506" class="sentence">29  This is the wicked man’s share from God,The inheritance that God has decreed for him.”</span></p></level1>
