<p><span id="p1036" class="sentence">Jehovah continued to answer Job:</span>
<span id="p1037" class="sentence">2  “Should a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
Let the one who wants to reprove God answer.”</span>
<span id="p1038" class="sentence">3  Job said in answer to Jehovah:</span>
<span id="p1039" class="sentence">4  “Look! I am unworthy.
What can I reply to you?
I put my hand over my mouth.</span>
<span id="p1040" class="sentence">5  I spoke once, but I will not answer again;Twice, but I will say no more.”</span>
<span id="p1041" class="sentence">6  Then Jehovah answered Job out of the windstorm:</span>
<span id="p1042" class="sentence">7  “Brace yourself, please, like a man;I will question you, and you inform me.</span>
<span id="p1043" class="sentence">8  Will you call into question my justice?
Will you condemn me so that you may be right?</span>
<span id="p1044" class="sentence">9  Do you have an arm as powerful as the true God’s,Or can your voice thunder like his?</span>
<span id="p1045" class="sentence">10  Adorn yourself, please, with glory and majesty;Clothe yourself with dignity and splendor.</span>
<span id="p1046" class="sentence">11  Release the fury of your anger;Look at everyone who is haughty, and bring him low.</span>
<span id="p1047" class="sentence">12  Look at everyone who is haughty, and humble him,And tread down the wicked where they stand.</span>
<span id="p1048" class="sentence">13  Hide them all in the dust;Bind them in the hidden place,</span>
<span id="p1049" class="sentence">14  Then even I would acknowledge to youThat your right hand can save you.</span>
<span id="p1050" class="sentence">15  Here, now, is Be·heʹmoth, which I made as I made you.
It eats grass like a bull.</span>
<span id="p1051" class="sentence">16  Look at the strength in its hipsAnd the power in the muscles of its belly!</span>
<span id="p1052" class="sentence">17  It stiffens its tail like a cedar;The sinews of its thighs are woven together.</span>
<span id="p1053" class="sentence">18  Its bones are tubes of copper;Its limbs are like wrought-iron rods.</span>
<span id="p1054" class="sentence">19  It ranks first among the works of God;Only its Maker can approach it with his sword.</span>
<span id="p1055" class="sentence">20  For the mountains produce food for it,Where all the wild animals play.</span>
<span id="p1056" class="sentence">21  It lies down under the lotus trees,In the shelter of the reeds of the marsh.</span>
<span id="p1057" class="sentence">22  The lotus trees cast their shadow on it,And the poplars of the valley surround it.</span>
<span id="p1058" class="sentence">23  If the river is turbulent, it does not panic.
It is confident, although the Jordan rushes against its mouth.</span>
<span id="p1059" class="sentence">24  Can anyone capture it while it is watching,Or pierce its nose with a hook?</span></p></level1>
