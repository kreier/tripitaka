<level1><h1 id="p1004">Chapter 39</h1>
<p><span id="p1005" class="sentence">“Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?
Have you watched the deer give birth to their young?</span>
<span id="p1006" class="sentence">2  Do you count the months that they must complete?
Do you know the time when they give birth?</span>
<span id="p1007" class="sentence">3  They crouch down when they give birth to their young,And their labor pains end.</span>
<span id="p1008" class="sentence">4  Their young become strong and grow up in the open field;They go out and do not return to them.</span>
<span id="p1009" class="sentence">5  Who set the wild donkey free,And who untied the ropes of the wild donkey?</span>
<span id="p1010" class="sentence">6  I have made the desert plain its homeAnd the salt land its dwelling.</span>
<span id="p1011" class="sentence">7  It scorns the tumult of the city;It does not hear the shouts of the driver.</span>
<span id="p1012" class="sentence">8  It roams the hills, seeking pasture,Looking for every green plant.</span>
<span id="p1013" class="sentence">9  Is the wild bull willing to serve you?
Will it spend the night in your stable?</span>
<span id="p1014" class="sentence">10  Will you hold a wild bull to the furrow with a rope,Or will it follow you to plow the valley?</span>
<span id="p1015" class="sentence">11  Will you trust in its great strengthAnd let it do your heavy work?</span>
<span id="p1016" class="sentence">12  Will you rely on it to bring back your harvest,And will it gather it to your threshing floor?</span>
<span id="p1017" class="sentence">13  The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,But can her pinions and plumage compare with the stork’s?</span>
<span id="p1018" class="sentence">14  For she leaves her eggs on the ground,And she keeps them warm in the dust.</span>
<span id="p1019" class="sentence">15  She forgets that some foot may crush themOr that a wild animal may trample them.</span>
<span id="p1020" class="sentence">16  She treats her sons harshly, as if they were not hers;She has no fear that her labor may be in vain.</span>
<span id="p1021" class="sentence">17  For God has deprived her of wisdomAnd given her no share in understanding.</span>
<span id="p1022" class="sentence">18  But when she rises up and flaps her wings,She laughs at the horse and at its rider.</span>
<span id="p1023" class="sentence">19  Are you the one who gives the horse its strength?
Do you clothe its neck with a rustling mane?</span>
<span id="p1024" class="sentence">20  Can you cause it to leap like a locust?
Its majestic snorting is terrifying.</span>
<span id="p1025" class="sentence">21  It paws the ground in the valley and exults mightily;It charges into the battle.</span>
<span id="p1026" class="sentence">22  It laughs at fear and is afraid of nothing.
It does not turn back because of the sword.</span>
<span id="p1027" class="sentence">23  The quiver rattles against it,The spear and the javelin flash.</span>
<span id="p1028" class="sentence">24  Trembling with excitement, it surges forward,It cannot stand still at the sound of the horn.</span>
<span id="p1029" class="sentence">25  When the horn blows, it says, ‘Aha!’
It smells the battle from afarAnd hears the shouting of commanders and the battle cry.</span>
<span id="p1030" class="sentence">26  Is it by your understanding that the falcon soars,Spreading its wings to the south?</span>
<span id="p1031" class="sentence">27  Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upwardAnd builds its nest high up,</span>
<span id="p1032" class="sentence">28  Spending the night on a cliff,Dwelling in its stronghold on a rocky crag?</span>
<span id="p1033" class="sentence">29  From there it searches for food;Its eyes look far into the distance.</span>
<span id="p1034" class="sentence">30  Its young sip up blood;And wherever the slain are, there it is.”</span></p></level1>
