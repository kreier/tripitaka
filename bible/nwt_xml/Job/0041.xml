<level1><h1 id="p1060">Chapter 41</h1>
<p><span id="p1061" class="sentence">“Can you catch Le·viʹa·than with a fishhookOr hold down its tongue with a rope?</span>
<span id="p1062" class="sentence">2  Can you put a rope through its nostrilsOr pierce its jaws with a hook?</span>
<span id="p1063" class="sentence">3  Will it make many pleas to you,Or will it speak gently to you?</span>
<span id="p1064" class="sentence">4  Will it make a covenant with you,So that you may make it your slave for life?</span>
<span id="p1065" class="sentence">5  Will you play with it as with a birdOr tie it on a leash for your little girls?</span>
<span id="p1066" class="sentence">6  Will traders barter for it?
Will they divide it up among merchants?</span>
<span id="p1067" class="sentence">7  Will you fill its hide with harpoonsOr its head with fishing spears?</span>
<span id="p1068" class="sentence">8  Lay your hand on it;You will remember the battle and never do it again!</span>
<span id="p1069" class="sentence">9  Any hope of subduing it is futile.
The mere sight of it would overwhelm you.</span>
<span id="p1070" class="sentence">10  No one dares to stir it up.
So who is it who can stand up to me?</span>
<span id="p1071" class="sentence">11  Who has given me anything first that I should repay him?
Whatever is under the heavens is mine.</span>
<span id="p1072" class="sentence">12  I will not be silent about its limbs,About its mightiness and its well-formed body.</span>
<span id="p1073" class="sentence">13  Who has removed its outer covering?
Who will enter its open jaws?</span>
<span id="p1074" class="sentence">14  Who can pry open the doors of its mouth?
Its teeth all around are fearsome.</span>
<span id="p1075" class="sentence">15  Its back has rows of scalesTightly sealed together.</span>
<span id="p1076" class="sentence">16  Each one fits so closely to the otherThat no air can come between them.</span>
<span id="p1077" class="sentence">17  They are stuck to one another;They cling together and cannot be separated.</span>
<span id="p1078" class="sentence">18  Its snorting flashes out light,And its eyes are like the rays of dawn.</span>
<span id="p1079" class="sentence">19  Flashes of lightning go out of its mouth;Fiery sparks escape.</span>
<span id="p1080" class="sentence">20  Smoke pours out of its nostrils,Like a furnace fueled with rushes.</span>
<span id="p1081" class="sentence">21  Its breath sets coals ablaze,And a flame shoots from its mouth.</span>
<span id="p1082" class="sentence">22  There is great strength in its neck,And dismay runs before it.</span>
<span id="p1083" class="sentence">23  The folds of its flesh are tightly joined together;They are firm, as though cast upon it and immovable.</span>
<span id="p1084" class="sentence">24  Its heart is hard as stone,Yes, hard as a lower millstone.</span>
<span id="p1085" class="sentence">25  When it rises up, even the mighty are frightened;Its thrashing causes bewilderment.</span>
<span id="p1086" class="sentence">26  No sword that reaches it will prevail;Nor will spear, dart, or arrowhead.</span>
<span id="p1087" class="sentence">27  It regards iron as straw,Copper as rotten wood.</span>
<span id="p1088" class="sentence">28  An arrow does not make it flee;Slingstones turn into stubble against it.</span>
<span id="p1089" class="sentence">29  It regards a club as stubble,And it laughs at the rattling of a javelin.</span>
<span id="p1090" class="sentence">30  Underneath, it is like sharp fragments of pottery;It spreads itself in the mud like a threshing sledge.</span>
<span id="p1091" class="sentence">31  It makes the deep boil just like a pot;It stirs up the sea like an ointment pot.</span>
<span id="p1092" class="sentence">32  It leaves a glistening wake in its path.
One would think that the deep had white hair.</span>
<span id="p1093" class="sentence">33  There is nothing like it on the earth,A creature made to have no fear.</span>
<span id="p1094" class="sentence">34  It glares at everything that is haughty.
It is king over all the majestic wild beasts.”</span></p></level1>
