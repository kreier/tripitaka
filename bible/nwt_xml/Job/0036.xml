<p><span id="p904" class="sentence">E·liʹhu continued:</span>
<span id="p905" class="sentence">2  “Be patient with me a little longer while I explain,For I still have words to speak on God’s behalf.</span>
<span id="p906" class="sentence">3  I will speak comprehensively about what I know,And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span>
<span id="p907" class="sentence">4  Truly my words are not false;The One perfect in knowledge is here before you.</span>
<span id="p908" class="sentence">5  Indeed, God is mighty and rejects no one;He is great in his power of understanding.</span>
<span id="p909" class="sentence">6  He will not preserve the lives of the wicked,But he gives justice to the afflicted.</span>
<span id="p910" class="sentence">7  He does not take his eyes off the righteous;He enthrones them with kings, and they are exalted forever.</span>
<span id="p911" class="sentence">8  But if they are bound in shacklesAnd caught in ropes of affliction,</span>
<span id="p912" class="sentence">9  He reveals to them what they have done,Their transgressions caused by their pride.</span>
<span id="p913" class="sentence">10  He opens their ears to correctionAnd tells them to turn away from wrongdoing.</span>
<span id="p914" class="sentence">11  If they obey and serve him,They will live out their days in prosperity,And their years will be pleasant.</span>
<span id="p915" class="sentence">12  But if they do not obey, they will perish by the swordAnd die without knowledge.</span>
<span id="p916" class="sentence">13  The godless at heart will harbor resentment.
They do not cry for help even when he binds them.</span>
<span id="p917" class="sentence">14  They die while still young,Spending their life among male temple prostitutes.</span>
<span id="p918" class="sentence">15  But God rescues the afflicted during their affliction;He opens their ear when they are oppressed.</span>
<span id="p919" class="sentence">16  He draws you away from the brink of distressTo a broad space, free of restriction,With rich food on your table as consolation.</span>
<span id="p920" class="sentence">17  Then you will be satisfied with the judgment on the wicked,When judgment is rendered and justice is upheld.</span>
<span id="p921" class="sentence">18  But take care that rage does not lead you into spitefulness,And do not let a large bribe lead you astray.</span>
<span id="p922" class="sentence">19  Would your cry for helpOr any of your strenuous efforts keep you from distress?</span>
<span id="p923" class="sentence">20  Do not long for the night,When people vanish from their place.</span>
<span id="p924" class="sentence">21  Beware that you do not turn to wrongdoing,Choosing this instead of affliction.</span>
<span id="p925" class="sentence">22  Look! God is exalted in his power;What instructor is like him?</span>
<span id="p926" class="sentence">23  Who has directed his wayOr said to him, ‘What you have done is wrong’?</span>
<span id="p927" class="sentence">24  Remember to magnify his activity,Of which men have sung.</span>
<span id="p928" class="sentence">25  All mankind has seen it,Mortal man looks on from a distance.</span>
<span id="p929" class="sentence">26  Yes, God is greater than we can know;The number of his years is beyond comprehension.</span>
<span id="p930" class="sentence">27  He draws up the drops of water;They condense into rain from his mist;</span>
<span id="p931" class="sentence">28  Then the clouds pour it down;They shower down upon mankind.</span>
<span id="p932" class="sentence">29  Can anyone understand the layers of clouds,The thundering from his tent?</span>
<span id="p933" class="sentence">30  See how he spreads his lightning over itAnd covers the depths of the sea.</span>
<span id="p934" class="sentence">31  By these he sustains the peoples;He gives them food in abundance.</span>
<span id="p935" class="sentence">32  With his hands he covers the lightning,And he directs it against its target.</span>
<span id="p936" class="sentence">33  His thunder tells about him,Even the livestock tell who is coming.</span></p></level1>
