<p><span id="p251" class="sentence">Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite said in reply:</span>
<span id="p252" class="sentence">2  “Will all these words go unanswered,Or will a lot of talking make someone right?</span>
<span id="p253" class="sentence">3  Will your empty talk silence people?
Will no one rebuke you for your mocking words?</span>
<span id="p254" class="sentence">4  For you say, ‘My teaching is pure,And I am clean in your eyes.’</span>
<span id="p255" class="sentence">5  But if only God would speakAnd open his lips to you!</span>
<span id="p256" class="sentence">6  Then he would reveal to you the secrets of wisdom,For practical wisdom has many sides.
Then you would realize that God allows some of your error to be forgotten.</span>
<span id="p257" class="sentence">7  Can you discover the deep things of GodOr discover everything about the Almighty?</span>
<span id="p258" class="sentence">8  It is higher than heaven. What can you accomplish?
It is deeper than the Grave. What can you know?</span>
<span id="p259" class="sentence">9  It is longer than the earthAnd broader than the sea.</span>
<span id="p260" class="sentence">10  If he passes by and detains someone and convenes a court,Who can resist him?</span>
<span id="p261" class="sentence">11  For he knows when men are deceitful.
When he sees what is evil, will he not take notice?</span>
<span id="p262" class="sentence">12  But an empty-headed man will understandOnly when a wild donkey can give birth to a man.</span>
<span id="p263" class="sentence">13  If only you would prepare your heartAnd stretch out your hands to him.</span>
<span id="p264" class="sentence">14  If your hand is doing wrong, put it far away,And let no unrighteousness dwell in your tents.</span>
<span id="p265" class="sentence">15  For then you could lift up your face with no defect;You could stand firm, free of fear.</span>
<span id="p266" class="sentence">16  For then you will forget your trouble;You will remember it as waters that have flowed past you.</span>
<span id="p267" class="sentence">17  Your life will become brighter than midday;Even its darkness will be like the morning.</span>
<span id="p268" class="sentence">18  You will be confident because there is hope,And you will look around and lie down in security.</span>
<span id="p269" class="sentence">19  You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid,And many people will seek your favor.</span>
<span id="p270" class="sentence">20  But the eyes of the wicked will fail;And they will find no place to escape,And their only hope will be death.”</span></p></level1>
