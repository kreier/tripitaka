<level1><h1 id="p146">Chapter 7</h1>
<p><span id="p147" class="sentence">“Is not the life of mortal man on earth like compulsory labor,And are not his days like those of a hired worker?</span>
<span id="p148" class="sentence">2  Like a slave, he longs for the shadow,And like a hired worker, he waits for his wages.</span>
<span id="p149" class="sentence">3  Thus I have been assigned months of futilityAnd nights of misery have been counted out for me.</span>
<span id="p150" class="sentence">4  When I lie down I ask, ‘When will I get up?’
But as the night drags on, I toss restlessly until the dawning of the day.</span>
<span id="p151" class="sentence">5  My flesh is covered with maggots and clods of dirt;My skin is full of scabs and pus.</span>
<span id="p152" class="sentence">6  My days go by more quickly than a weaver’s shuttle,And they come to an end without hope.</span>
<span id="p153" class="sentence">7  Remember that my life is wind,That my eye will never again see happiness.</span>
<span id="p154" class="sentence">8  The eye that sees me now will see me no more;Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.</span>
<span id="p155" class="sentence">9  Like a cloud that fades and vanishes,The one who goes down to the Grave does not come back up.</span>
<span id="p156" class="sentence">10  He will not return again to his house,And his place will acknowledge him no more.</span>
<span id="p157" class="sentence">11  Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth.
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;I will complain in my bitter distress!</span>
<span id="p158" class="sentence">12  Am I the sea or a sea monster,That you should set a guard over me?</span>
<span id="p159" class="sentence">13  When I say, ‘My couch will comfort me;My bed will help ease my misery,’</span>
<span id="p160" class="sentence">14  Then you terrify me with dreamsAnd frighten me with visions,</span>
<span id="p161" class="sentence">15  So that I would choose suffocation,Yes, death rather than this body of mine.</span>
<span id="p162" class="sentence">16  I loathe my life; I do not want to go on living.
Leave me alone, for my days are like a breath.</span>
<span id="p163" class="sentence">17  What is mortal man that you should concern yourself with himAnd fix your attention on him?</span>
<span id="p164" class="sentence">18  Why do you inspect him every morningAnd test him every moment?</span>
<span id="p165" class="sentence">19  Will you not look away from meAnd leave me alone long enough to swallow my saliva?</span>
<span id="p166" class="sentence">20  If I have sinned, how could I harm you, the Observer of mankind?
Why have you made me your target?
Have I become a burden to you?</span>
<span id="p167" class="sentence">21  Why do you not pardon my transgressionAnd excuse my error?
For soon I will lie down in the dust,And you will look for me, but I will be gone.”</span></p></level1>
