<p><span id="p116" class="sentence">Job then said in reply:</span>
<span id="p117" class="sentence">2  “If only my anguish could be fully weighedAnd put on scales together with my calamity!</span>
<span id="p118" class="sentence">3  For now it is heavier than the sands of the seas.
That is why my words have been wild talk.</span>
<span id="p119" class="sentence">4  For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me,And my spirit is drinking their venom;The terrors from God are lined up against me.</span>
<span id="p120" class="sentence">5  Will a wild donkey cry out when it has grass,Or will a bull bellow when it has fodder?</span>
<span id="p121" class="sentence">6  Is tasteless food eaten without salt,Or is there flavor in the juice of a mallow?</span>
<span id="p122" class="sentence">7  I have refused to touch such things.
They are like contamination in my food.</span>
<span id="p123" class="sentence">8  O that my request would be realizedAnd that God would grant my desire!</span>
<span id="p124" class="sentence">9  That God would be willing to crush me,And that he would reach out his hand and do away with me!</span>
<span id="p125" class="sentence">10  For even that would bring me comfort;I would leap for joy despite the unrelenting pain,For I have not denied the sayings of the Holy One.</span>
<span id="p126" class="sentence">11  Do I have the strength to keep waiting?
And what end awaits me, that I should continue to live?</span>
<span id="p127" class="sentence">12  Is my strength like that of rock?
Or is my flesh made of copper?</span>
<span id="p128" class="sentence">13  Is there any way that I can help myselfWhen all my means of support has been driven from me?</span>
<span id="p129" class="sentence">14  Anyone who withholds loyal love from his fellow manWill forsake the fear of the Almighty.</span>
<span id="p130" class="sentence">15  My own brothers have been as treacherous as a winter stream,Like the water of winter streams that dry up.</span>
<span id="p131" class="sentence">16  They are darkened by ice,And in them the melting snow is hidden.</span>
<span id="p132" class="sentence">17  But in due season they become waterless and come to an end;When it becomes hot, they dry up.</span>
<span id="p133" class="sentence">18  Their course is diverted;They flow into the desert and vanish.</span>
<span id="p134" class="sentence">19  The caravans of Teʹma look for them;The travelers from Sheʹba wait for them.</span>
<span id="p135" class="sentence">20  They are ashamed because of their misplaced trust;They come there only to be disappointed.</span>
<span id="p136" class="sentence">21  For this is how you have become to me;You have seen the terror of my calamity, and you are afraid.</span>
<span id="p137" class="sentence">22  Have I said, ‘Give me something,’
Or requested that you make a gift for me from your wealth?</span>
<span id="p138" class="sentence">23  Have I asked to be rescued from the hand of an enemyOr to be saved from oppressors?</span>
<span id="p139" class="sentence">24  Instruct me, and I will be silent;Help me to understand my mistake.</span>
<span id="p140" class="sentence">25  Honest words are not painful!
But what benefit can be found in your reproof?</span>
<span id="p141" class="sentence">26  Are you scheming to reprove my words,A desperate man’s sayings, which the wind blows away?</span>
<span id="p142" class="sentence">27  You would also cast lots over an orphanAnd sell your own friend!</span>
<span id="p143" class="sentence">28  So now turn and look at me,For I would not lie to your very faces.</span>
<span id="p144" class="sentence">29  Reconsider, please—do not misjudge me—Yes, reconsider, for my righteousness is yet intact.</span>
<span id="p145" class="sentence">30  Is my tongue speaking unjustly?
Does my palate not discern that something is wrong?</span></p></level1>
