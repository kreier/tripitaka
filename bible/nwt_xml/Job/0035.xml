<p><span id="p887" class="sentence">E·liʹhu continued his response:</span>
<span id="p888" class="sentence">2  “Are you so convinced that you are right that you would say,‘I am more righteous than God’?</span>
<span id="p889" class="sentence">3  For you say, ‘What does it matter to you?
Am I better off than if I had sinned?’</span>
<span id="p890" class="sentence">4  I will reply to youAnd to your companions with you.</span>
<span id="p891" class="sentence">5  Look up to heaven and see,Observe the clouds, which are high above you.</span>
<span id="p892" class="sentence">6  If you sin, how do you hurt him?
If your transgressions multiply, what do you do to him?</span>
<span id="p893" class="sentence">7  If you are righteous, what do you give him;What does he receive from you?</span>
<span id="p894" class="sentence">8  Your wickedness affects only a human like yourself,And your righteousness, a son of man.</span>
<span id="p895" class="sentence">9  People cry out when under great oppression;They cry for relief from the domination of the powerful.</span>
<span id="p896" class="sentence">10  But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Grand Maker,The one causing songs to be sung in the night?’</span>
<span id="p897" class="sentence">11  He teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,And he makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens.</span>
<span id="p898" class="sentence">12  People cry out, but he does not answer,Because of the pride of the wicked.</span>
<span id="p899" class="sentence">13  Surely God does not hear an empty cry;The Almighty does not pay attention to it.</span>
<span id="p900" class="sentence">14  How much less, then, when you complain that you do not see him!
Your legal case is before him, so you should wait anxiously for him.</span>
<span id="p901" class="sentence">15  For he has not angrily called for an accounting;Nor has he taken note of your extreme rashness.</span>
<span id="p902" class="sentence">16  Job opens his mouth wide in vain;He multiplies words without knowledge.”</span></p></level1>
