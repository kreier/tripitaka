<level1><h1 id="p507">Chapter 21</h1>
<p><span id="p508" class="sentence">Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p509" class="sentence">2  “Listen carefully to what I say;Let this be the consolation you give me.</span>
<span id="p510" class="sentence">3  Bear with me while I speak;After I speak, you may then mock me.</span>
<span id="p511" class="sentence">4  Is my complaint directed toward a man?
If it were, would I not lose patience?</span>
<span id="p512" class="sentence">5  Look at me and stare in amazement;Put your hand over your mouth.</span>
<span id="p513" class="sentence">6  When I think about it, I am disturbed,And my whole body shudders.</span>
<span id="p514" class="sentence">7  Why do the wicked live on,Grow old, and become wealthy?</span>
<span id="p515" class="sentence">8  Their children are always in their presence,And they get to see their descendants.</span>
<span id="p516" class="sentence">9  Their houses are secure, they are free from fear,And God does not punish them with his rod.</span>
<span id="p517" class="sentence">10  Their bulls breed without failure;Their cows give birth and do not miscarry.</span>
<span id="p518" class="sentence">11  Their boys run outside just like a flock,And their children skip about.</span>
<span id="p519" class="sentence">12  They sing accompanied by tambourine and harpAnd rejoice at the sound of the flute.</span>
<span id="p520" class="sentence">13  They spend their days in contentmentAnd go down peacefully to the Grave.</span>
<span id="p521" class="sentence">14  But they say to the true God, ‘Leave us alone!
We have no desire to know your ways.</span>
<span id="p522" class="sentence">15  Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
What would we gain by being acquainted with him?’</span>
<span id="p523" class="sentence">16  But I know that they do not control their own prosperity.
The thinking of the wicked is far from me.</span>
<span id="p524" class="sentence">17  How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished?
How often does disaster come upon them?
How often does God deal out destruction to them in his anger?</span>
<span id="p525" class="sentence">18  Do they ever become like straw before the windAnd like chaff that a storm wind carries away?</span>
<span id="p526" class="sentence">19  God will store up a man’s punishment for his own sons.
But may God repay him so that he will know it.</span>
<span id="p527" class="sentence">20  May his own eyes see his ruin,And may he be the one to drink from the rage of the Almighty.</span>
<span id="p528" class="sentence">21  For what does he care about what happens to his house after himIf the number of his months is cut short?</span>
<span id="p529" class="sentence">22  Can anyone teach knowledge to God,When He is the one who judges even the highest ones?</span>
<span id="p530" class="sentence">23  One man dies in his full vigorWhen he is completely carefree and at ease,</span>
<span id="p531" class="sentence">24  When his thighs are padded with fatAnd his bones are strong.</span>
<span id="p532" class="sentence">25  But another man dies deeply distressed,Never having tasted good things.</span>
<span id="p533" class="sentence">26  Together they will lie down in the dust,And maggots will cover both of them.</span>
<span id="p534" class="sentence">27  Look! I know exactly what you are thinkingAnd the schemes you devise to wrong me.</span>
<span id="p535" class="sentence">28  For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prominent man,And where is the tent in which the wicked one lived?’</span>
<span id="p536" class="sentence">29  Have you not questioned travelers?
Do you not carefully study their observations,</span>
<span id="p537" class="sentence">30  That an evil person is spared on the day of disasterAnd rescued on the day of fury?</span>
<span id="p538" class="sentence">31  Who will confront him about his way,And who will repay him for what he has done?</span>
<span id="p539" class="sentence">32  When he is carried to the graveyard,A vigil will be kept over his tomb.</span>
<span id="p540" class="sentence">33  The clods of earth of the valley will be sweet to him,And all mankind follows after himLike the countless number before him.</span>
<span id="p541" class="sentence">34  So why offer me meaningless comfort?
There is nothing but deceit in your answers!”</span></p></level1>
