<p><span id="p426" class="sentence">Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite said in reply:</span>
<span id="p427" class="sentence">2  “How long before you stop making such speeches?
Show some understanding so that we may then speak.</span>
<span id="p428" class="sentence">3  Why should we be viewed as animalsAnd be considered stupid in your eyes?</span>
<span id="p429" class="sentence">4  Even if you tear yourself to pieces in your anger,Will the earth be abandoned for your sake,Or will the rock move away from its place?</span>
<span id="p430" class="sentence">5  Yes, the light of the wicked will be extinguished,And the flame of his fire will not shine.</span>
<span id="p431" class="sentence">6  The light in his tent will certainly grow dark,And the lamp over him will be extinguished.</span>
<span id="p432" class="sentence">7  His vigorous stride is shortened,And his own counsel will make him fall.</span>
<span id="p433" class="sentence">8  For his feet will lead him into a net,And he will wander onto its mesh.</span>
<span id="p434" class="sentence">9  A trap will seize him by the heel;A snare will catch him.</span>
<span id="p435" class="sentence">10  A rope is hidden for him on the ground,And a trap lies in his path.</span>
<span id="p436" class="sentence">11  Terrors frighten him on all sidesAnd chase him at his feet.</span>
<span id="p437" class="sentence">12  His strength fails him,And disaster will make him stagger.</span>
<span id="p438" class="sentence">13  His skin is eaten away;The most deadly disease consumes his limbs.</span>
<span id="p439" class="sentence">14  He is torn away from the security of his tentAnd marched to the king of terrors.</span>
<span id="p440" class="sentence">15  Strangers will live in his tent;Sulfur will be scattered on his home.</span>
<span id="p441" class="sentence">16  His roots will dry up beneath him,And his branches will wither above him.</span>
<span id="p442" class="sentence">17  The memory of him will fade from the earth,And in the street his name will be unknown.</span>
<span id="p443" class="sentence">18  He will be driven from the light into the darknessAnd chased away from the productive land.</span>
<span id="p444" class="sentence">19  He will have no offspring and no descendants among his people,And he will be without a survivor in the place where he lives.</span>
<span id="p445" class="sentence">20  When his day comes, the people in the West will be appalledAnd the people in the East will be seized with horror.</span>
<span id="p446" class="sentence">21  This is what happens to the tents of a wrongdoerAnd to the place of the one who has not known God.”</span></p></level1>
