<p><span id="p88" class="sentence">“Call, please! Is there anyone answering you?
To which of the holy ones will you turn?</span>
<span id="p89" class="sentence">2  For resentment will kill the foolish one,And envy will put the simpleminded to death.</span>
<span id="p90" class="sentence">3  I have seen the foolish one taking root,But suddenly his dwelling place is cursed.</span>
<span id="p91" class="sentence">4  His sons are far from safety,And they are crushed at the city gate, with no one to save them.</span>
<span id="p92" class="sentence">5  The hungry one eats what he harvests,Taking it even from among the thorns,And their possessions are ensnared.</span>
<span id="p93" class="sentence">6  For harmful things do not sprout from the dust,And trouble does not spring from the ground.</span>
<span id="p94" class="sentence">7  For man is born for trouble,As surely as sparks fly upward.</span>
<span id="p95" class="sentence">8  But I would appeal to God,And to God I would submit my case,</span>
<span id="p96" class="sentence">9  To the One doing great and unsearchable things,Wonderful things without number.</span>
<span id="p97" class="sentence">10  He gives rain to the earthAnd sends waters upon the fields.</span>
<span id="p98" class="sentence">11  He raises the lowly up high,And he raises up the dejected one to salvation.</span>
<span id="p99" class="sentence">12  He frustrates the schemes of the crafty,So that the work of their hands does not succeed.</span>
<span id="p100" class="sentence">13  He catches the wise in their own cunning,So that the plans of the shrewd are thwarted.</span>
<span id="p101" class="sentence">14  They meet with darkness during the day,And they grope about at midday as if it were night.</span>
<span id="p102" class="sentence">15  He saves from the sword of their mouth,Saving the poor from the hand of the strong,</span>
<span id="p103" class="sentence">16  So that there is hope for the lowly,But the mouth of unrighteousness is shut.</span>
<span id="p104" class="sentence">17  Look! Happy is the man whom God reproves;So do not reject the discipline of the Almighty!</span>
<span id="p105" class="sentence">18  For he causes pain, but binds up the wound;He breaks apart, but heals with his own hands.</span>
<span id="p106" class="sentence">19  He will save you from six calamities,Even the seventh will not harm you.</span>
<span id="p107" class="sentence">20  During famine he will redeem you from death,And from the power of a sword during war.</span>
<span id="p108" class="sentence">21  You will be protected from the lash of the tongue,And you will not fear devastation when it comes.</span>
<span id="p109" class="sentence">22  You will laugh at destruction and hunger,And you will not fear the wild beasts of the earth.</span>
<span id="p110" class="sentence">23  For the stones of the field will not harm you,And the wild beasts of the field will be at peace with you.</span>
<span id="p111" class="sentence">24  You will know that your tent is secure,And nothing will be missing when you inspect your pasture.</span>
<span id="p112" class="sentence">25  You will enjoy many children,And your descendants will be as plentiful as the vegetation of the earth.</span>
<span id="p113" class="sentence">26  You will still be strong when you go to the grave,Like sheaves of grain gathered in their season.</span>
<span id="p114" class="sentence">27  Look! We have investigated this, and it is so.
Listen and accept it.”</span></p></level1>
