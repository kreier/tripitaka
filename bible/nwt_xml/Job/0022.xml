<level1><h1 id="p542">Chapter 22</h1>
<p><span id="p543" class="sentence">Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite said in reply:</span>
<span id="p544" class="sentence">2  “Can a man be of use to God?
Can anyone with insight be of benefit to him?</span>
<span id="p545" class="sentence">3  Does the Almighty care that you are righteous,Or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity?</span>
<span id="p546" class="sentence">4  Will he punish youAnd enter into judgment with you for your reverence?</span>
<span id="p547" class="sentence">5  Is it not because your own wickedness is so greatAnd there is no end to your errors?</span>
<span id="p548" class="sentence">6  For you seize a pledge from your brothers for no reason,And you strip people of their garments, leaving them naked.</span>
<span id="p549" class="sentence">7  You do not give the tired one a drink of water,And you hold back food from the hungry.</span>
<span id="p550" class="sentence">8  The land belongs to the powerful man,And the favored one dwells in it.</span>
<span id="p551" class="sentence">9  But you sent away widows empty-handed,And you crushed the arms of fatherless children.</span>
<span id="p552" class="sentence">10  That is why you are surrounded by traps,And sudden terrors frighten you;</span>
<span id="p553" class="sentence">11  That is why it is so dark that you cannot see,And a flood of water covers you.</span>
<span id="p554" class="sentence">12  Is not God in the heights of heaven?
And see how high all the stars are.</span>
<span id="p555" class="sentence">13  But you have said: ‘What does God really know?
Can he judge through thick gloom?</span>
<span id="p556" class="sentence">14  Clouds screen him off so that he does not seeAs he walks about on the vault of heaven.’</span>
<span id="p557" class="sentence">15  Will you follow the ancient pathThat wicked men have walked,</span>
<span id="p558" class="sentence">16  Men who have been snatched away before their time,Whose foundation was washed away by a flood?</span>
<span id="p559" class="sentence">17  They were saying to the true God: ‘Leave us alone!’
And ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’</span>
<span id="p560" class="sentence">18  Yet, he is the One who filled their houses with good things.
(Such wicked thinking is far from my own.)</span>
<span id="p561" class="sentence">19  The righteous will see this and rejoice,And the innocent will mock them and say:</span>
<span id="p562" class="sentence">20  ‘Our opponents have been destroyed,And a fire will consume what is left of them.’</span>
<span id="p563" class="sentence">21  Get to know Him, and you will be at peace;Then good things will come your way.</span>
<span id="p564" class="sentence">22  Accept the law from his mouth,And keep his sayings in your heart.</span>
<span id="p565" class="sentence">23  If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored;If you remove unrighteousness from your tent,</span>
<span id="p566" class="sentence">24  If you would throw your gold into the dustAnd the gold of Oʹphir into the rocky ravines,</span>
<span id="p567" class="sentence">25  Then the Almighty will become your gold,And he will be your choicest silver.</span>
<span id="p568" class="sentence">26  For then your delight will be in the Almighty,And you will lift up your face to God.</span>
<span id="p569" class="sentence">27  You will entreat him, and he will hear you;And your vows you will pay.</span>
<span id="p570" class="sentence">28  Whatever you decide to do will succeed,And light will shine upon your path.</span>
<span id="p571" class="sentence">29  For you will be humiliated when you speak arrogantly,But he will save the humble.</span>
<span id="p572" class="sentence">30  He will rescue those who are innocent;So if your hands are clean, you will certainly be rescued.”</span></p></level1>
