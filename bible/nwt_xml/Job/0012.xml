<level1><h1 id="p271">Chapter 12</h1>
<p><span id="p272" class="sentence">Then Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p273" class="sentence">2  “Surely you are the people who know,And wisdom will die out with you!</span>
<span id="p274" class="sentence">3  But I too have understanding.
I am not inferior to you.
Who does not know these things?</span>
<span id="p275" class="sentence">4  I have become a laughingstock to my companions,One calling to God for an answer.
A righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock.</span>
<span id="p276" class="sentence">5  The carefree person has contempt for calamity,Thinking it is only for those whose feet are unsteady.</span>
<span id="p277" class="sentence">6  The tents of robbers are at peace,And those who provoke God are secure,Those who have their god in their hands.</span>
<span id="p278" class="sentence">7  However, ask, please, the animals, and they will instruct you;Also the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you.</span>
<span id="p279" class="sentence">8  Or give consideration to the earth, and it will instruct you;And the fish of the sea will declare it to you.</span>
<span id="p280" class="sentence">9  Who among all these does not knowThat the hand of Jehovah has done this?</span>
<span id="p281" class="sentence">10  In his hand is the life of every living thingAnd the spirit of every human.</span>
<span id="p282" class="sentence">11  Does not the ear test out wordsAs the tongue tastes food?</span>
<span id="p283" class="sentence">12  Is not wisdom found among the aged,And does not understanding come with a long life?</span>
<span id="p284" class="sentence">13  With him there are wisdom and mightiness;He has counsel and understanding.</span>
<span id="p285" class="sentence">14  When he tears something down, it cannot be rebuilt;What he has shut, no man can open.</span>
<span id="p286" class="sentence">15  When he withholds the waters, everything dries up;When he sends them out, they overwhelm the earth.</span>
<span id="p287" class="sentence">16  With him there are strength and practical wisdom;To him belong the one going astray and the one leading astray;</span>
<span id="p288" class="sentence">17  He makes counselors go barefoot,And he makes fools of judges.</span>
<span id="p289" class="sentence">18  He loosens the bonds imposed by kings,And he binds a belt around their waist.</span>
<span id="p290" class="sentence">19  He makes priests walk barefoot,And he overthrows those who are firmly established in power;</span>
<span id="p291" class="sentence">20  He deprives trusted advisers of speechAnd takes away the sensibleness of old men;</span>
<span id="p292" class="sentence">21  He pours out contempt upon nobles,And he makes powerful ones weak;</span>
<span id="p293" class="sentence">22  He reveals deep things from the darkness,And he brings deep darkness into the light;</span>
<span id="p294" class="sentence">23  He makes nations grow great in order to destroy them;He enlarges nations, that he may lead them into exile.</span>
<span id="p295" class="sentence">24  He takes away the understanding of the leaders of the peopleAnd makes them wander in trackless wastelands.</span>
<span id="p296" class="sentence">25  They grope in darkness, where there is no light;He makes them wander about like drunken men.</span></p></level1>
