<level1><h1 id="p718">Chapter 30</h1>
<p><span id="p719" class="sentence">“Now they laugh at me—Men younger than I am,Whose fathers I would have refusedTo put with the dogs that guarded my flock.</span>
<span id="p720" class="sentence">2  Of what use was the power of their hands to me?
Their vigor has perished.</span>
<span id="p721" class="sentence">3  They are worn out from want and hunger;They gnaw at the parched groundThat was already ruined and desolated.</span>
<span id="p722" class="sentence">4  They gather the salt herb from the bushes;Their food is the root of broom trees.</span>
<span id="p723" class="sentence">5  They are driven out of the community;People shout at them as they would at a thief.</span>
<span id="p724" class="sentence">6  They live on the slopes of ravines,In holes in the ground and in the rocks.</span>
<span id="p725" class="sentence">7  From the bushes they cry outAnd huddle together among the nettles.</span>
<span id="p726" class="sentence">8  As sons of the senseless and the nameless ones,They have been driven out of the land.</span>
<span id="p727" class="sentence">9  But now they mock me even in their songs;I have become an object of scorn to them.</span>
<span id="p728" class="sentence">10  They detest me and keep their distance from me;They do not hesitate to spit in my face.</span>
<span id="p729" class="sentence">11  Because God has disarmed me and humbled me,They throw off all restraint in my presence.</span>
<span id="p730" class="sentence">12  On my right they rise up like a mob;They put me to flightAnd put up barriers of destruction in my path.</span>
<span id="p731" class="sentence">13  They tear up my roadwaysAnd make my calamity worse,Without anyone to stop them.</span>
<span id="p732" class="sentence">14  They come as if through a wide breach in the wall;They roll in amid the devastation.</span>
<span id="p733" class="sentence">15  Terror overwhelms me;My dignity is driven away like the wind,And my salvation vanishes like a cloud.</span>
<span id="p734" class="sentence">16  Now my life ebbs from me;Days of affliction take hold of me.</span>
<span id="p735" class="sentence">17  Aching pierces my bones at night;The gnawing pain never stops.</span>
<span id="p736" class="sentence">18  With great force my garment is disfigured;Like the collar of my garment, it chokes me.</span>
<span id="p737" class="sentence">19  God has thrown me down into the mud;I am reduced to dust and ashes.</span>
<span id="p738" class="sentence">20  I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me;I stand up, but you just look at me.</span>
<span id="p739" class="sentence">21  You have cruelly turned against me;With the full might of your hand, you assault me.</span>
<span id="p740" class="sentence">22  You pick me up and carry me off with the wind;Then you toss me about in the storm.</span>
<span id="p741" class="sentence">23  For I know that you will bring me down to death,To the house where everyone living will meet.</span>
<span id="p742" class="sentence">24  But no one would strike at a broken manAs he cries for help during his time of disaster.</span>
<span id="p743" class="sentence">25  Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times?
Have I not grieved for the poor?</span>
<span id="p744" class="sentence">26  Although I hoped for good, bad came;I expected the light, but darkness came.</span>
<span id="p745" class="sentence">27  The churning inside me did not stop;Days of affliction confronted me.</span>
<span id="p746" class="sentence">28  I walk about gloomy; there is no sunlight.
In the assembly, I rise and cry for help.</span>
<span id="p747" class="sentence">29  I have become a brother to jackalsAnd a companion to the daughters of the ostrich.</span>
<span id="p748" class="sentence">30  My skin has blackened and fallen off;My bones burn from the heat.</span>
<span id="p749" class="sentence">31  My harp is used only for mourning,And my flute for the sound of weeping.</span></p></level1>
