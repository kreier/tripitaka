<level1><h1 id="p848">Chapter 34</h1>
<p><span id="p849" class="sentence">So E·liʹhu continued to say in reply:</span>
<span id="p850" class="sentence">2  “Listen to my words, you who are wise;Hear me, you who know so much.</span>
<span id="p851" class="sentence">3  For the ear tests wordsJust as the tongue tastes food.</span>
<span id="p852" class="sentence">4  Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right;Let us decide among ourselves what is good.</span>
<span id="p853" class="sentence">5  For Job has said, ‘I am in the right,But God has denied me justice.</span>
<span id="p854" class="sentence">6  Would I lie about what my own judgment should be?
My wound is incurable, though there is no transgression.’</span>
<span id="p855" class="sentence">7  What other man is like Job,Who drinks up derision like water?</span>
<span id="p856" class="sentence">8  He is in company with wrongdoersAnd in association with wicked men.</span>
<span id="p857" class="sentence">9  For he has said, ‘A man does not benefitFrom trying to please God.’</span>
<span id="p858" class="sentence">10  So listen to me, you men of understanding:
It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly,For the Almighty to do wrong!</span>
<span id="p859" class="sentence">11  For he will reward a man according to what he doesAnd bring upon him the consequences of his ways.</span>
<span id="p860" class="sentence">12  For a certainty, God does not act wickedly;The Almighty does not pervert justice.</span>
<span id="p861" class="sentence">13  Who put him in charge of the earth,And who appointed him over the whole world?</span>
<span id="p862" class="sentence">14  If he fixes his attention on them,If he gathers their spirit and breath to himself,</span>
<span id="p863" class="sentence">15  All humans would perish together,And mankind would return to the dust.</span>
<span id="p864" class="sentence">16  So if you have understanding, pay attention to this;Listen carefully to what I say.</span>
<span id="p865" class="sentence">17  Should someone who hates justice be in control,Or would you condemn a powerful one who is righteous?</span>
<span id="p866" class="sentence">18  Would you say to a king, ‘You are good for nothing,’
Or to nobles, ‘You are wicked’?</span>
<span id="p867" class="sentence">19  There is One who does not show partiality to princesAnd who does not favor the rich over the poor,For they are all the work of his hands.</span>
<span id="p868" class="sentence">20  They may die suddenly, in the middle of the night;They shake violently and pass away;Even the powerful are removed, but not by human hands.</span>
<span id="p869" class="sentence">21  For God’s eyes are upon the ways of a man,And He sees all his steps.</span>
<span id="p870" class="sentence">22  There is no darkness or deep shadowWhere wrongdoers can conceal themselves.</span>
<span id="p871" class="sentence">23  For God has not set an appointed time for any manTo appear before him in judgment.</span>
<span id="p872" class="sentence">24  He breaks the powerful without needing to investigateAnd sets up others in their place.</span>
<span id="p873" class="sentence">25  For he knows what they are doing;He overthrows them during the night, and they are crushed.</span>
<span id="p874" class="sentence">26  He strikes them for their wickedness,In a place where all can see,</span>
<span id="p875" class="sentence">27  Because they have turned away from following himAnd have no regard for any of his ways;</span>
<span id="p876" class="sentence">28  They cause the poor to cry out to him,So that he hears the outcry of the helpless.</span>
<span id="p877" class="sentence">29  When God remains silent, who can condemn him?
When he hides his face, who can see him?
Whether toward a nation or a man, the result is the same,</span>
<span id="p878" class="sentence">30  So that a godless person may not ruleOr lay snares for the people.</span>
<span id="p879" class="sentence">31  For will anyone say to God,‘I have been punished, although I have committed no offense;</span>
<span id="p880" class="sentence">32  Teach me what I have failed to see;If I have done anything wrong, I will not do it again’?</span>
<span id="p881" class="sentence">33  Should he reward you on your terms when you reject his judgment?
You must decide, not I.
So tell me what you know so well.</span>
<span id="p882" class="sentence">34  Men of understanding will say to me—Any wise man who hears me—</span>
<span id="p883" class="sentence">35  ‘Job speaks without knowledge,And his words lack insight.’</span>
<span id="p884" class="sentence">36  Let Job be tested to the limitBecause his replies are like those of wicked men!</span>
<span id="p885" class="sentence">37  He adds rebellion to his sin;He scornfully claps his hands before usAnd multiplies his words against the true God!”</span></p></level1>
