<level1><h1 id="p191">Chapter 9</h1>
<p><span id="p192" class="sentence">Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p193" class="sentence">2  “For a fact I know that this is so.
But how can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?</span>
<span id="p194" class="sentence">3  If someone wishes to argue with Him,That one could not answer one of His questions in a thousand.</span>
<span id="p195" class="sentence">4  He is wise in heart and mighty in power.
Who can resist him and come off uninjured?</span>
<span id="p196" class="sentence">5  He moves mountains without anyone knowing it;He overturns them in his anger.</span>
<span id="p197" class="sentence">6  He shakes the earth out of its place,So that its pillars tremble.</span>
<span id="p198" class="sentence">7  He commands the sun not to shineAnd seals off the light of the stars;</span>
<span id="p199" class="sentence">8  He spreads out the heavens by himself,And he treads upon the high waves of the sea.</span>
<span id="p200" class="sentence">9  He made the Ash, the Keʹsil, and the Kiʹmah constellations,And the constellations of the southern sky;</span>
<span id="p201" class="sentence">10  He does great and unsearchable things,Wonderful things that cannot be counted.</span>
<span id="p202" class="sentence">11  He passes by me, and I cannot see him;He moves past me, but I do not discern him.</span>
<span id="p203" class="sentence">12  When he snatches something, who can resist him?
Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’</span>
<span id="p204" class="sentence">13  God will not restrain his anger;Even the helpers of Raʹhab will bow down to him.</span>
<span id="p205" class="sentence">14  How much more when I answer himMust I choose my words carefully to argue with him!</span>
<span id="p206" class="sentence">15  Even if I were in the right, I would not answer him.
I could only plead for mercy from my judge.</span>
<span id="p207" class="sentence">16  If I call out to him, will he answer me?
I do not believe that he will listen to my voice,</span>
<span id="p208" class="sentence">17  For he crushes me with a stormAnd multiplies my wounds for no reason.</span>
<span id="p209" class="sentence">18  He does not let me catch my breath;He keeps filling me with bitter things.</span>
<span id="p210" class="sentence">19  If it is a matter of power, he is the strong one.
If it is a matter of justice, he says: ‘Who can call me to account?’</span>
<span id="p211" class="sentence">20  If I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me;Even if I keep my integrity, he will declare me guilty.</span>
<span id="p212" class="sentence">21  Even if I keep my integrity, I am not confident about myself;I reject this life of mine.</span>
<span id="p213" class="sentence">22  It is all the same. That is why I say,‘He destroys the innocent and the wicked alike.’</span>
<span id="p214" class="sentence">23  If a flash flood should cause sudden death,He would mock at the despair of the innocent.</span>
<span id="p215" class="sentence">24  The earth has been handed over to the wicked;He covers the eyes of its judges.
If it is not he, then, who is it?</span>
<span id="p216" class="sentence">25  Now my days are swifter than a runner;They run away without seeing good.</span>
<span id="p217" class="sentence">26  They glide by like reed boats,Like eagles that swoop down on their prey.</span>
<span id="p218" class="sentence">27  If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,I will change my expression and be cheerful,’</span>
<span id="p219" class="sentence">28  I would still be afraid because of all my pains,And I know you would not find me innocent.</span>
<span id="p220" class="sentence">29  I would be found guilty.
So why should I struggle in vain?</span>
<span id="p221" class="sentence">30  If I wash myself in water from melting snow,And I cleanse my hands in lye,</span>
<span id="p222" class="sentence">31  Then you would dip me in a pit,So that even my own garments would detest me.</span>
<span id="p223" class="sentence">32  For he is not a man like me that I may answer him,That we should go to court together.</span>
<span id="p224" class="sentence">33  There is no person to decide between us,Who could serve as our judge.</span>
<span id="p225" class="sentence">34  If he would stop beating meAnd not let his terror frighten me,</span>
<span id="p226" class="sentence">35  Then I would speak to him unafraid,For it is not in me to speak out of fear.</span></p></level1>
