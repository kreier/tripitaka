<level1><h1 id="p297">Chapter 13</h1>
<p><span id="p298" class="sentence">“Yes, my eye has seen all of this,My ear has heard and understood it.</span>
<span id="p299" class="sentence">2  What you know, I also know;I am not inferior to you.</span>
<span id="p300" class="sentence">3  For my part, I would rather speak to the Almighty himself;I desire to argue my case with God.</span>
<span id="p301" class="sentence">4  But you are smearing me with lies;All of you are useless physicians.</span>
<span id="p302" class="sentence">5  If only you would keep absolutely silent,That would show wisdom on your part.</span>
<span id="p303" class="sentence">6  Listen, please, to my arguments,And pay attention to the pleadings of my lips.</span>
<span id="p304" class="sentence">7  Will you speak unjustly on God’s behalf,And will you speak deceitfully for him?</span>
<span id="p305" class="sentence">8  Will you take his side,Will you try to plead the case of the true God?</span>
<span id="p306" class="sentence">9  Would it turn out well if he examined you?
Will you fool him as you would a mortal man?</span>
<span id="p307" class="sentence">10  He will surely rebuke youIf you secretly try to show favoritism.</span>
<span id="p308" class="sentence">11  Will not his very dignity terrify youAnd the dread of him fall upon you?</span>
<span id="p309" class="sentence">12  Your wise sayings are proverbs of ashes;Your defenses are as fragile as defenses of clay.</span>
<span id="p310" class="sentence">13  Keep silent before me, so that I may speak.
Then let whatever may come upon me come!</span>
<span id="p311" class="sentence">14  Why do I put myself in dangerAnd take my life in my hands?</span>
<span id="p312" class="sentence">15  Though he may slay me, I would still wait;I would argue my case before his face.</span>
<span id="p313" class="sentence">16  He would then become my salvation,For no godless person may come in before him.</span>
<span id="p314" class="sentence">17  Listen closely to my word;Pay attention to my declaration.</span>
<span id="p315" class="sentence">18  See, now, I have prepared my legal case;I know I am in the right.</span>
<span id="p316" class="sentence">19  Who will contend with me?
I would die if I were to stay silent!</span>
<span id="p317" class="sentence">20  Only grant two things to me, O God,So that I will not conceal myself from before you:</span>
<span id="p318" class="sentence">21  Remove your heavy hand far away from me,And do not let the fear of you terrify me.</span>
<span id="p319" class="sentence">22  Either call and I will answer,Or let me speak, and you answer me.</span>
<span id="p320" class="sentence">23  What are my errors and sins?
Reveal to me my transgression and my sin.</span>
<span id="p321" class="sentence">24  Why do you hide your faceAnd consider me your enemy?</span>
<span id="p322" class="sentence">25  Will you try to frighten a windblown leafOr chase after dry stubble?</span>
<span id="p323" class="sentence">26  For you keep recording bitter accusations against me,And you make me answer for the sins of my youth.</span>
<span id="p324" class="sentence">27  You have put my feet in stocks,You scrutinize all my paths,And you trace out each of my footprints.</span>
<span id="p325" class="sentence">28  So man decays like something rotten,Like a garment eaten by moths.</span></p></level1>
