<p><span id="p350" class="sentence">Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite said in reply:</span>
<span id="p351" class="sentence">2  “Will a wise person answer with empty arguments,Or will he fill his belly with the east wind?</span>
<span id="p352" class="sentence">3  Reproving with mere words is useless,And talk alone is of no benefit.</span>
<span id="p353" class="sentence">4  For you undermine the fear of God,And you diminish any concern for God.</span>
<span id="p354" class="sentence">5  For your error dictates what you say,And you choose crafty speech.</span>
<span id="p355" class="sentence">6  Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;Your own lips testify against you.</span>
<span id="p356" class="sentence">7  Were you the first man ever born,Or was your birth before that of the hills?</span>
<span id="p357" class="sentence">8  Do you listen to the confidential talk of God,Or do you limit wisdom to yourself?</span>
<span id="p358" class="sentence">9  What do you know that we do not know?
What do you understand that we do not?</span>
<span id="p359" class="sentence">10  Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,Men much older than your father.</span>
<span id="p360" class="sentence">11  Are God’s consolations not enough for you,Or words spoken gently to you?</span>
<span id="p361" class="sentence">12  Why does your heart carry you away,And why do your eyes flash with anger?</span>
<span id="p362" class="sentence">13  For you turn your spirit against God himself,And you allow such words to go out of your own mouth.</span>
<span id="p363" class="sentence">14  What is mortal man that he should be pure,Or anyone born of a woman that he should be righteous?</span>
<span id="p364" class="sentence">15  Look! He has no faith in his holy ones,And even the heavens are not pure in his eyes.</span>
<span id="p365" class="sentence">16  How much less so when a person is detestable and corrupt,A man who drinks in unrighteousness just like water!</span>
<span id="p366" class="sentence">17  I will inform you; listen to me!
I will relate what I have seen,</span>
<span id="p367" class="sentence">18  What wise men have related from their fathers,Things they have not hidden.</span>
<span id="p368" class="sentence">19  To them alone the land was given,And no stranger passed among them.</span>
<span id="p369" class="sentence">20  A wicked person suffers torment all his days,Throughout all the years reserved for the tyrant.</span>
<span id="p370" class="sentence">21  Terrifying sounds are in his ears;In a time of peace, marauders attack him.</span>
<span id="p371" class="sentence">22  He does not believe that he will escape from darkness;He is reserved for a sword.</span>
<span id="p372" class="sentence">23  He wanders about in search of food—where is it?
He well knows that the day of darkness is at hand.</span>
<span id="p373" class="sentence">24  Distress and anguish keep terrifying him;They overpower him like a king ready to launch an attack.</span>
<span id="p374" class="sentence">25  For he raises his hand against God himselfAnd tries to defy the Almighty;</span>
<span id="p375" class="sentence">26  He stubbornly rushes against Him,With his thick, strong shield;</span>
<span id="p376" class="sentence">27  His face is covered with fat,And his hips bulge with fat;</span>
<span id="p377" class="sentence">28  He resides in cities that will be brought to ruin,In houses where no one will dwell,Which will become heaps of stones.</span>
<span id="p378" class="sentence">29  He will not grow rich, and his wealth will not accumulate,Nor will his possessions spread over the land.</span>
<span id="p379" class="sentence">30  He will not escape from darkness;A flame will dry up his twig,And he will pass away by a blast of God’s mouth.</span>
<span id="p380" class="sentence">31  He should not go astray and trust in what is worthless,For what he gets in exchange will be worthless;</span>
<span id="p381" class="sentence">32  It will happen before his day,And his branches will never flourish.</span>
<span id="p382" class="sentence">33  He will be like a vine that shakes off its unripe grapes,And like an olive tree that casts off its blossoms.</span>
<span id="p383" class="sentence">34  For the assembly of godless ones is sterile,And fire will consume the tents of bribery.</span>
<span id="p384" class="sentence">35  They conceive trouble and give birth to what is wicked,And their womb produces deceit.”</span></p></level1>
