<level1><h1 id="p750">Chapter 31</h1>
<p><span id="p751" class="sentence">“I have made a covenant with my eyes.
So how could I show improper attention to a virgin?</span>
<span id="p752" class="sentence">2  What, then, would be my share from God above,What inheritance from the Almighty on high?</span>
<span id="p753" class="sentence">3  Does not disaster await the wrongdoerAnd calamity those doing what is harmful?</span>
<span id="p754" class="sentence">4  Does he not see my waysAnd count all my steps?</span>
<span id="p755" class="sentence">5  Have I ever walked in untruth?
Has my foot hurried to deceive?</span>
<span id="p756" class="sentence">6  Let God weigh me with accurate scales;Then he will recognize my integrity.</span>
<span id="p757" class="sentence">7  If my footsteps deviate from the wayOr my heart has followed after my eyesOr my hands have been defiled,</span>
<span id="p758" class="sentence">8  Then let me sow seed and someone else eat,And let what I plant be uprooted.</span>
<span id="p759" class="sentence">9  If my heart has been enticed by a womanAnd I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door,</span>
<span id="p760" class="sentence">10  Then let my wife grind grain for another man,And let other men have sexual relations with her.</span>
<span id="p761" class="sentence">11  For that would be shameful conduct,An error deserving punishment by the judges.</span>
<span id="p762" class="sentence">12  It would be a fire that would devour and destroy,Consuming even the roots of all my produce.</span>
<span id="p763" class="sentence">13  If I denied justice to my male or female servantsWhen they had a complaint against me,</span>
<span id="p764" class="sentence">14  What can I do when God confronts me?
What can I answer him when he calls for an accounting?</span>
<span id="p765" class="sentence">15  Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them?
Was it not the same One who formed us before our birth?</span>
<span id="p766" class="sentence">16  If I refused to give the poor what they desiredOr saddened the eyes of the widow;</span>
<span id="p767" class="sentence">17  If I ate my portion of food aloneWithout sharing it with the orphans;</span>
<span id="p768" class="sentence">18  (For from my youth the orphan grew up with me as though I were his father,And I have been a guide for the widow from childhood.)</span>
<span id="p769" class="sentence">19  If I saw anyone perishing for lack of clothingOr a poor man with nothing to cover himself;</span>
<span id="p770" class="sentence">20  If he did not bless meAs he warmed himself with the wool of my sheep;</span>
<span id="p771" class="sentence">21  If I shook my fist against the orphanWhen he needed my assistance in the city gate;</span>
<span id="p772" class="sentence">22  Then let my arm fall from my shoulder,And let my arm be broken at the elbow.</span>
<span id="p773" class="sentence">23  For I dreaded disaster from God,And I could not stand before his dignity.</span>
<span id="p774" class="sentence">24  If I put my confidence in goldOr said to fine gold, ‘You are my security!’</span>
<span id="p775" class="sentence">25  If I found my joy in my great wealthBecause of the many possessions I acquired;</span>
<span id="p776" class="sentence">26  If I saw the sun shiningOr the moon moving in its splendor;</span>
<span id="p777" class="sentence">27  And my heart was secretly enticed,And my mouth kissed my hand in worship of them;</span>
<span id="p778" class="sentence">28  Then that would be an error deserving punishment by the judges,For I would have denied the true God above.</span>
<span id="p779" class="sentence">29  Have I ever rejoiced over the destruction of my enemyOr gloated because evil befell him?</span>
<span id="p780" class="sentence">30  I never allowed my mouth to sinBy asking for his life in an oath.</span>
<span id="p781" class="sentence">31  Have the men of my tent not said,‘Who can find anyone who has not been satisfied with his food?’</span>
<span id="p782" class="sentence">32  No stranger had to spend the night outside;I opened my doors to the traveler.</span>
<span id="p783" class="sentence">33  Have I ever tried to cover over my transgressions, like other men,By hiding my error in the pocket of my garment?</span>
<span id="p784" class="sentence">34  Have I been in fear of the reaction of the multitude,Or have I been terrified by the contempt of other families,Making me silent and afraid to go outside?</span>
<span id="p785" class="sentence">35  If only someone would listen to me!
I would sign my name to what I have said.
Let the Almighty answer me!
If only my accuser had written out the charges in a document!</span>
<span id="p786" class="sentence">36  I would carry it on my shoulder,And I would bind it around my head like a crown.</span>
<span id="p787" class="sentence">37  I would give him an accounting for every step I took;I would approach him confidently, like a prince.</span>
<span id="p788" class="sentence">38  If my own ground would cry out against meAnd its furrows would weep together;</span>
<span id="p789" class="sentence">39  If I have eaten its fruitage without payment,Or if I have caused its owners to despair;</span>
<span id="p790" class="sentence">40  Then let thorns sprout for me instead of wheatAnd foul-smelling weeds instead of barley.”
The words of Job end here.</span></p></level1>
