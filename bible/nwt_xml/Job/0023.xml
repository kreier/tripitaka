<p><span id="p574" class="sentence">Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p575" class="sentence">2  “Even today I will complain stubbornly;My strength is exhausted because of my sighing.</span>
<span id="p576" class="sentence">3  If only I knew where to find God!
I would go to his place of dwelling.</span>
<span id="p577" class="sentence">4  I would present my case before himAnd fill my mouth with arguments;</span>
<span id="p578" class="sentence">5  I would learn how he would answer meAnd take note of what he says to me.</span>
<span id="p579" class="sentence">6  Would he contend with me using his great power?
No, surely he would give me a hearing.</span>
<span id="p580" class="sentence">7  There the upright one could set matters straight with him,And I would be acquitted once and for all by my Judge.</span>
<span id="p581" class="sentence">8  But if I go east, he is not there;And I return and I cannot find him.</span>
<span id="p582" class="sentence">9  When he is working on the left, I cannot look upon him;Then he turns to the right, but I still do not see him.</span>
<span id="p583" class="sentence">10  But he knows the path I have taken.
After he has tested me, I will come out as pure gold.</span>
<span id="p584" class="sentence">11  My feet have closely followed his footsteps;I have kept to his way without deviating.</span>
<span id="p585" class="sentence">12  I have not departed from the commandment of his lips.
I have treasured up his sayings even more than what was required of me.</span>
<span id="p586" class="sentence">13  When he is determined, who can resist him?
When he wants to do something, he does it.</span>
<span id="p587" class="sentence">14  For he will carry out completely what has been determined for me,And he has many such things in store.</span>
<span id="p588" class="sentence">15  That is why I am anxious because of him;When I think about him, my fear grows.</span>
<span id="p589" class="sentence">16  God has made me fainthearted,And the Almighty has made me afraid.</span>
<span id="p590" class="sentence">17  But I have not yet been silenced by the darknessNor by the gloom that has covered my face.</span></p></level1>
