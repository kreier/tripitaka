<p><span id="p409" class="sentence">“My spirit has been broken, my days have been extinguished;The graveyard awaits me.</span>
<span id="p410" class="sentence">2  Mockers surround me,And my eye must gaze at their rebellious behavior.</span>
<span id="p411" class="sentence">3  Please accept my security, and keep it with you.
Who else will shake hands with me and pledge in my behalf?</span>
<span id="p412" class="sentence">4  For you have concealed discernment from their heart;That is why you do not exalt them.</span>
<span id="p413" class="sentence">5  He may offer to share with his friends,While the eyes of his children fail.</span>
<span id="p414" class="sentence">6  He has made me an object of scorn among the peoples,So that I became one in whose face they spit.</span>
<span id="p415" class="sentence">7  From anguish my eyes grow dim,And all my limbs are but a shadow.</span>
<span id="p416" class="sentence">8  Upright people stare in amazement at this,And the innocent one is disturbed over the godless.</span>
<span id="p417" class="sentence">9  The righteous one keeps holding fast to his way,And the one with clean hands grows stronger.</span>
<span id="p418" class="sentence">10  However, you may all come and resume your arguing,For I have not found anyone wise among you.</span>
<span id="p419" class="sentence">11  My days are finished;My plans, the desires of my heart, have been shattered.</span>
<span id="p420" class="sentence">12  They keep turning night into day,Saying, ‘Light must be near because it is dark.’</span>
<span id="p421" class="sentence">13  If I wait, the Grave will become my home;I will spread out my bed in darkness.</span>
<span id="p422" class="sentence">14  I will call out to the pit, ‘You are my father!’
To the maggot, ‘My mother and my sister!’</span>
<span id="p423" class="sentence">15  Where, then, is my hope?
Who can see hope for me?</span>
<span id="p424" class="sentence">16  It will go down to the barred gates of the GraveWhen we all descend together into the dust.”</span></p></level1>
