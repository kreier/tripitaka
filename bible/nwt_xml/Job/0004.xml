<p><span id="p66" class="sentence">Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite then said in reply:</span>
<span id="p67" class="sentence">2  “If someone tries to speak to you, will you become impatient?
For who can hold back from speaking?</span>
<span id="p68" class="sentence">3  True, you have corrected many,And you used to strengthen the weak hands.</span>
<span id="p69" class="sentence">4  Your words would raise up anyone stumbling,And you would strengthen those whose knees were buckling.</span>
<span id="p70" class="sentence">5  But now it has happened to you, and you are overwhelmed;It touches you, and you are dismayed.</span>
<span id="p71" class="sentence">6  Does your reverence for God not give you confidence?
Does your way of integrity not give you hope?</span>
<span id="p72" class="sentence">7  Remember, please: What innocent person has ever perished?
When have the upright ever been destroyed?</span>
<span id="p73" class="sentence">8  What I have seen is that those who plow what is harmfulAnd those who sow trouble will reap the same.</span>
<span id="p74" class="sentence">9  By the breath of God they perish,And through a blast of his anger they come to an end.</span>
<span id="p75" class="sentence">10  The lion roars, and a young lion growls,But even the teeth of strong lions are broken.</span>
<span id="p76" class="sentence">11  A lion perishes for lack of prey,And the cubs of a lion are scattered.</span>
<span id="p77" class="sentence">12  Now a word was brought to me in secret,And a whisper of it reached my ear.</span>
<span id="p78" class="sentence">13  In troubling thoughts during visions of the night,When deep sleep falls upon men,</span>
<span id="p79" class="sentence">14  A terrible trembling came upon me,Filling all my bones with dread.</span>
<span id="p80" class="sentence">15  A spirit passed over my face;The hair of my flesh bristled.</span>
<span id="p81" class="sentence">16  It then stood still,But I did not recognize its appearance.
A form was in front of my eyes;There was a calm, and then I heard a voice:</span>
<span id="p82" class="sentence">17  ‘Can a mortal man be more righteous than God?
Can a man be cleaner than his own Maker?’</span>
<span id="p83" class="sentence">18  Look! He has no faith in his servants,And he finds fault with his angels.</span>
<span id="p84" class="sentence">19  How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay,Whose foundation is in the dust,Who are crushed as easily as a moth!</span>
<span id="p85" class="sentence">20  They are completely crushed from morning to evening;They perish forever, and no one takes notice.</span>
<span id="p86" class="sentence">21  Are they not like a tent whose cord is pulled out?
They die without wisdom.</span></p></level1>
