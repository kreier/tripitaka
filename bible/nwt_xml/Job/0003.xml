<level1><h1 id="p38">Chapter 3</h1>
<p><span id="p39" class="sentence">It was after this that Job began to speak and to curse the day of his birth.</span>
<span id="p40" class="sentence">2  Job said:</span>
<span id="p41" class="sentence">3  “Let the day perish on which I was born,Also the night when someone said: ‘A man has been conceived!’</span>
<span id="p42" class="sentence">4  Let that day be darkness.
Let God above show no concern for it;Let no light shine upon it.</span>
<span id="p43" class="sentence">5  Let the deepest darkness reclaim it.
Let a rain cloud settle over it.
Let whatever darkens the day terrify it.</span>
<span id="p44" class="sentence">6  That night—let the gloom seize it;Let it not rejoice among the days of a year,And let it not enter among the number of the months.</span>
<span id="p45" class="sentence">7  Indeed! Let that night become barren;Let no joyful cry be heard in it.</span>
<span id="p46" class="sentence">8  Let those who curse the day put a curse on it,Those who are able to awaken Le·viʹa·than.</span>
<span id="p47" class="sentence">9  Let the stars of its twilight grow dark;Let it wait in vain for daylight,And let it not see the rays of dawn.</span>
<span id="p48" class="sentence">10  For it did not close the doors of my mother’s womb;Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</span>
<span id="p49" class="sentence">11  Why did I not die at birth?
Why did I not perish when I came from the womb?</span>
<span id="p50" class="sentence">12  Why were there knees to receive meAnd breasts to nurse me?</span>
<span id="p51" class="sentence">13  For now I would be lying down undisturbed;I would be sleeping and at rest</span>
<span id="p52" class="sentence">14  With kings of the earth and their advisers,Who built for themselves places that are now in ruins,</span>
<span id="p53" class="sentence">15  Or with princes who possessed gold,Whose houses were filled with silver.</span>
<span id="p54" class="sentence">16  Or why was I not like a hidden miscarriage,Like children who have never seen the light?</span>
<span id="p55" class="sentence">17  There even the wicked have ceased from agitation;There the weary are at rest.</span>
<span id="p56" class="sentence">18  There the prisoners are at ease together;They do not hear the voice of the one forcing them to work.</span>
<span id="p57" class="sentence">19  Small and great are the same there,And the slave is set free from his master.</span>
<span id="p58" class="sentence">20  Why does he give light to one who is sufferingAnd life to those in bitter distress?</span>
<span id="p59" class="sentence">21  Why do they long for death, but it does not come?
They dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</span>
<span id="p60" class="sentence">22  Those who are rejoicing greatly,Who are happy when they find the grave.</span>
<span id="p61" class="sentence">23  Why does he give light to a man who has lost his way,Whom God has hedged in?</span>
<span id="p62" class="sentence">24  For in place of my food comes my sighing,And my groaning pours out like water.</span>
<span id="p63" class="sentence">25  For what I have dreaded has come upon me,And what I have feared has befallen me.</span>
<span id="p64" class="sentence">26  I have had no peace, no quiet, no rest,But trouble keeps coming.”</span></p></level1>
