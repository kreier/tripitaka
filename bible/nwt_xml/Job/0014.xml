<level1><h1 id="p326">Chapter 14</h1>
<p><span id="p327" class="sentence">“Man, born of woman,Is short-lived and filled with trouble.</span>
<span id="p328" class="sentence">2  He comes up like a blossom and then withers away;He flees like a shadow and disappears.</span>
<span id="p329" class="sentence">3  Yes, you have fixed your eye upon him,And you bring him into judgment with yourself.</span>
<span id="p330" class="sentence">4  Who can produce someone clean from someone unclean?
No one can!</span>
<span id="p331" class="sentence">5  If his days are decided,The number of his months is with you;You have set a limit for him that he may not go beyond.</span>
<span id="p332" class="sentence">6  Turn your gaze away from him so that he may rest,Until, like a hired worker, he finishes out his day.</span>
<span id="p333" class="sentence">7  For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again,And its twigs will continue to grow.</span>
<span id="p334" class="sentence">8  If its root grows old in the groundAnd its stump dies in the soil,</span>
<span id="p335" class="sentence">9  At the scent of water it will sprout;And it will produce branches like a new plant.</span>
<span id="p336" class="sentence">10  But a man dies and lies powerless;When a human expires, where is he?</span>
<span id="p337" class="sentence">11  Waters disappear from the sea,And a river drains away and dries up.</span>
<span id="p338" class="sentence">12  Man also lies down and does not get up.
Until heaven is no more, they will not wake up,Nor will they be aroused from their sleep.</span>
<span id="p339" class="sentence">13  O that in the Grave you would conceal me,That you would hide me until your anger passes by,That you would set a time limit for me and remember me!</span>
<span id="p340" class="sentence">14  If a man dies, can he live again?
I will wait all the days of my compulsory serviceUntil my relief comes.</span>
<span id="p341" class="sentence">15  You will call, and I will answer you.
You will long for the work of your hands.</span>
<span id="p342" class="sentence">16  But for now, you keep counting my every step;You watch only for my sin.</span>
<span id="p343" class="sentence">17  My transgression is sealed up in a bag,And you seal up my error with glue.</span>
<span id="p344" class="sentence">18  As a mountain falls and crumbles awayAnd a rock is dislodged from its place,</span>
<span id="p345" class="sentence">19  As water wears away stonesAnd its torrents wash away earth’s soil,So you have destroyed the hope of mortal man.</span>
<span id="p346" class="sentence">20  You keep overpowering him until he perishes;You change his appearance, and you send him away.</span>
<span id="p347" class="sentence">21  His sons are honored, but he does not know it;They become insignificant, but he does not realize it.</span>
<span id="p348" class="sentence">22  He feels pain only while he is still in his flesh;He mourns only while he is still alive.”</span></p></level1>
