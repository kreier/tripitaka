<p><span id="p448" class="sentence">Job said in reply:</span>
<span id="p449" class="sentence">2  “How long will you keep irritating my soul,Crushing me with words?</span>
<span id="p450" class="sentence">3  These ten times you have rebuked me;You are not ashamed to deal harshly with me.</span>
<span id="p451" class="sentence">4  And if indeed I made a mistake,My error remains with me.</span>
<span id="p452" class="sentence">5  If you insist on exalting yourselves over me,Claiming that the reproach against me is justified,</span>
<span id="p453" class="sentence">6  Know, then, that it is God who has misled me,And he has caught me in his hunting net.</span>
<span id="p454" class="sentence">7  Look! I keep crying out, ‘Violence!’ but I get no answer;I keep crying for help, but there is no justice.</span>
<span id="p455" class="sentence">8  My path he has blocked with a stone wall, and I cannot pass by;He has covered my roadways with darkness.</span>
<span id="p456" class="sentence">9  He has stripped me of my gloryAnd removed the crown from my head.</span>
<span id="p457" class="sentence">10  He breaks me down on all sides until I perish;My hope he uproots like a tree.</span>
<span id="p458" class="sentence">11  His anger burns against me,And he views me as his enemy.</span>
<span id="p459" class="sentence">12  His troops come together and besiege me,And they camp around my tent.</span>
<span id="p460" class="sentence">13  My own brothers he has driven far away from me,And those who know me have turned away from me.</span>
<span id="p461" class="sentence">14  My close companions are gone,And those whom I knew well have forgotten me.</span>
<span id="p462" class="sentence">15  Guests in my house and my slave girls consider me a stranger;I am a foreigner in their eyes.</span>
<span id="p463" class="sentence">16  I call for my servant, but he does not respond;With my mouth I beg him for compassion.</span>
<span id="p464" class="sentence">17  My very breath has become loathsome to my wife,And I am a stench to my own brothers.</span>
<span id="p465" class="sentence">18  Even young children despise me;When I rise up, they begin jeering at me.</span>
<span id="p466" class="sentence">19  All my close friends detest me,And those whom I loved have turned against me.</span>
<span id="p467" class="sentence">20  My bones stick to my skin and my flesh,And I escape with the skin of my teeth.</span>
<span id="p468" class="sentence">21  Show me mercy, my companions, show me mercy,For God’s own hand has touched me.</span>
<span id="p469" class="sentence">22  Why do you keep persecuting me as God does,Attacking me without letup?</span>
<span id="p470" class="sentence">23  If only my words were written down,If only they could be inscribed in a book!</span>
<span id="p471" class="sentence">24  O that they were carved forever in the rock,With an iron stylus and lead!</span>
<span id="p472" class="sentence">25  For I well know that my redeemer is alive;He will come later and rise up over the earth.</span>
<span id="p473" class="sentence">26  After my skin has thus been destroyed,While yet in my flesh, I will see God,</span>
<span id="p474" class="sentence">27  Whom I will see for myself,Whom my own eyes will see, not someone else’s.
But deep inside I feel overwhelmed!</span>
<span id="p475" class="sentence">28  For you say, ‘In what way are we persecuting him?’
Since the root of the problem is with me.</span>
<span id="p476" class="sentence">29  Be in fear of the sword yourselves,For the sword brings punishment against errors;You should know that there is a judge.”</span></p></level1>
