<level1><h1 id="p663">Chapter 28</h1>
<p><span id="p664" class="sentence">“There is a place to mine silverAnd a place for gold that they refine;</span>
<span id="p665" class="sentence">2  Iron is taken from the ground,And copper is smelted from rocks.</span>
<span id="p666" class="sentence">3  Man conquers the darkness;He probes to the limit in the gloom and darkness,Searching for ore.</span>
<span id="p667" class="sentence">4  He sinks a shaft far from where people reside,In forgotten places, far from where people walk;Some men descend and swing suspended.</span>
<span id="p668" class="sentence">5  Food grows on top of the earth;But below, there is an upheaval as if by fire.</span>
<span id="p669" class="sentence">6  There in the stones is sapphire,And the dust contains gold.</span>
<span id="p670" class="sentence">7  No bird of prey knows the path to it;The eye of a black kite has not seen it.</span>
<span id="p671" class="sentence">8  No majestic beasts have trodden on it;The young lion has not prowled there.</span>
<span id="p672" class="sentence">9  Man strikes the flinty rock with his hand;He overturns the mountains at their foundation.</span>
<span id="p673" class="sentence">10  He cuts water channels in the rock;His eyes spot every precious thing.</span>
<span id="p674" class="sentence">11  He dams up the sources of riversAnd brings what was hidden to the light.</span>
<span id="p675" class="sentence">12  But wisdom—where can it be found,And where is the source of understanding?</span>
<span id="p676" class="sentence">13  No man recognizes its value,And it cannot be found in the land of the living.</span>
<span id="p677" class="sentence">14  The deep waters say, ‘It is not in me!’
And the sea says, ‘It is not with me!’</span>
<span id="p678" class="sentence">15  It cannot be bought with pure gold;Nor can silver be weighed out in exchange for it.</span>
<span id="p679" class="sentence">16  It cannot be bought with gold of OʹphirNor with rare onyx and sapphire.</span>
<span id="p680" class="sentence">17  Gold and glass cannot be compared to it;Nor can a vessel of fine gold be exchanged for it.</span>
<span id="p681" class="sentence">18  Coral and crystal are not worthy of mention,For a bagful of wisdom is worth more than one full of pearls.</span>
<span id="p682" class="sentence">19  The topaz of Cush cannot be compared to it;It cannot be purchased even with pure gold.</span>
<span id="p683" class="sentence">20  But from where does wisdom come,And where is the source of understanding?</span>
<span id="p684" class="sentence">21  It has been hidden from the eyes of every living thingAnd concealed from the birds of the heavens.</span>
<span id="p685" class="sentence">22  Destruction and death say,‘Our ears have heard only a report of it.’</span>
<span id="p686" class="sentence">23  God understands the way to find it;He alone knows where it resides,</span>
<span id="p687" class="sentence">24  For he looks to the ends of the earth,And he sees everything under the heavens.</span>
<span id="p688" class="sentence">25  When he set the force of the windAnd measured out the waters,</span>
<span id="p689" class="sentence">26  When he made a regulation for the rainAnd a path for the thunderous storm cloud,</span>
<span id="p690" class="sentence">27  Then he saw wisdom and explained it;He established and tested it.</span>
<span id="p691" class="sentence">28  And he said to man:
‘Look! The fear of Jehovah—that is wisdom,And to turn away from bad is understanding.’”</span></p></level1>
