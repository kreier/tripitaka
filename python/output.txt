Genesis

|1| In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth
was formless and desolate, and there was darkness upon the surface of the
watery deep, and God’s active force was moving about over the surface of the
waters. 3 And God said: “Let there be light.“ Then there was light. 4
After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light
from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, but the darkness he called
Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day. 6 Then God
said: “Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let there be a
division between the waters and the waters.“ 7 Then God went on to make the
expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the
expanse. And it was so. 8 God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening
and there was morning, a second day. 9 Then God said: “Let the waters under
the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land
appear.“ And it was so. 10 God called the dry land Earth, but the collecting
of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 Then God said:
“Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees
according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.“ And
it was so. 12 And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants and
trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds. Then God saw
that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
14 Then God said: “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to
make a division between the day and the night, and they will serve as signs
for seasons and for days and years. 15 They will serve as luminaries in the
expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.“ And it was so. 16 And God
went on to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating
the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars. 
17 Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth 18
and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light
and the darkness. Then God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and
there was morning, a fourth day. 20 Then God said: “Let the waters swarm
with living creatures, and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the
expanse of the heavens.“ 21 And God created the great sea creatures and all
living creatures that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds
and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it
was good. 22 With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become
many and fill the waters of the sea, and let the flying creatures become many
in the earth.“ 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. 
24 Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to
their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the
earth according to their kinds.“ And it was so. 25 And God went on to make
the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic
animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground
according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 26 Then God said:
“Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have
in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and
the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is
moving on the earth.“ 27 And God went on to create the man in his image, in
God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. 28 Further, God
blessed them, and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the
earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying

                                       1

Genesis 1

creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the
earth.“ 29 Then God said: “Here I have given to you every seed-bearing
plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let
them serve as food for you. 30 And to every wild animal of the earth and to
every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in
which there is life, I have given all green vegetation for food.“ And it was
so. 31 After that God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.
And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. |2| Thus the heavens
and the earth and everything in them were completed. 2 And by the seventh day,
God had completed the work that he had been doing, and he began to rest on the
seventh day from all his work that he had been doing. 3 And God went on to
bless the seventh day and to declare it sacred, for on it God has been resting
from all the work that he has created, all that he purposed to make. 4 This is
a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created, in the
day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven. 5 No bush of the field was yet on
the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting, because Jehovah
God had not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the
ground. 6 But a mist would go up from the earth, and it watered the entire
surface of the ground. 7 And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust
from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man
became a living person. 8 Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in Eʹden,
toward the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 Thus Jehovah
God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and
good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the
tree of the knowledge of good and bad. 10 Now there was a river flowing out of
Eʹden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers. 11 The
name of the first is Piʹshon; it is the one encircling the entire land of
Havʹi·lah, where there is gold. 12 The gold of that land is good. Bdellium
gum and onyx stone are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Giʹhon;
it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush. 14 The name of the third
river is Hidʹde·kel; it is the one going to the east of As·syrʹi·a. And
the fourth river is the Eu·phraʹtes. 15 Jehovah God took the man and settled
him in the garden of Eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it. 16 Jehovah
God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you
may eat to satisfaction. 17 But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and
bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will
certainly die.“ 18 Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to
continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of
him.“ 19 Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal
of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing
them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would
call each living creature, that became its name. 20 So the man named all the
domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal
of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him. 21 So
Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was
sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.
22 And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman,
and he brought her to the man. 23 Then the man said:
“This is at last bone
of my bonesAnd flesh of my flesh.
This one will be called Woman,Because from
man she was taken.“ 24 That is why a man will leave his father and his
mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh. 25 And
both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife; yet they were not

                                       2

Genesis 2

ashamed. |3| Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of
the field that Jehovah God had made. So it said to the woman: “Did God
really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?“ 2 At this
the woman said to the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
garden. 3 But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle
of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it;
otherwise you will die.’“ 4 At this the serpent said to the woman: “You
certainly will not die. 5 For God knows that in the very day you eat from it,
your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.“ 6
Consequently, the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was
something desirable to the eyes, yes, the tree was pleasing to look at. So she
began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her
husband when he was with her, and he began eating it. 7 Then the eyes of both
of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig
leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves. 8 Later they heard the
voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden about the breezy part of
the day, and the man and his wife hid from the face of Jehovah God among the
trees of the garden. 9 And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to
him: “Where are you?“ 10 Finally he said: “I heard your voice in the
garden, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.“ 11 At that
he said: “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree
from which I commanded you not to eat?“ 12 The man said: “The woman whom
you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.“ 13
Jehovah God then said to the woman: “What is this you have done?“ The
woman replied: “The serpent deceived me, so I ate.“ 14 Then Jehovah God
said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are the cursed one out
of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild animals of the field. On
your belly you will go, and you will eat dust all the days of your life. 15
And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and
her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the
heel.“ 16 To the woman he said: “I will greatly increase the pain of your
pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children, and your longing will be
for your husband, and he will dominate you.“ 17 And to Adam he said:
“Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree
concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’
cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the
days of your life. 18 It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you must
eat the vegetation of the field. 19 In the sweat of your face you will eat
bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust
you are and to dust you will return.“ 20 After this Adam named his wife Eve,
because she was to become the mother of everyone living. 21 And Jehovah God
made long garments from skins for Adam and for his wife, to clothe them. 22
Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing
good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit
also from the tree of life and eat and live forever,—“ 23 With that
Jehovah God expelled him from the garden of Eʹden to cultivate the ground
from which he had been taken. 24 So he drove the man out, and he posted at the
east of the garden of Eʹden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that
was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life. |4| Now Adam
had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave
birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced a male child with the help of
Jehovah.“ 2 Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel.
Abel became a

Genesis 4

shepherd of the flock, but Cain became a cultivator of the ground. 3 After
some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah. 4
But Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat. While
Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering, 5 he did not look with
any favor on Cain and on his offering. So Cain grew hot with anger and was
dejected. 6 Then Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you so angry and dejected? 7
If you turn to doing good, will you not be restored to favor? But if you do
not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door, and its craving is to
dominate you; but will you get the mastery over it?“ 8 After that Cain said
to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.“ So while they were
in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him. 9 Later on,
Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?“ and he said: “I do
not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?“ 10 At this He said: “What have
you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. 
11 And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its
mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 12 When you cultivate
the ground, it will not give you back its produce. You will become a wanderer
and a fugitive in the earth.“ 13 At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The
punishment for my error is too great to bear. 14 Today you are driving me from
the land, and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer
and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill
me.“ 15 So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain
will suffer vengeance seven times.“
So Jehovah set up a sign for Cain in
order that no one finding him would strike him. 16 Then Cain went away from
before Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Exile, to the east of
Eʹden. 17 Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became
pregnant and gave birth to Eʹnoch. Then he engaged in building a city and
named the city after his son Eʹnoch. 18 Later Iʹrad was born to Eʹnoch. And
Iʹrad became father to Me·huʹja·el, and Me·huʹja·el became father to
Me·thuʹsha·el, and Me·thuʹsha·el became father to Laʹmech. 19 Laʹmech
took two wives for himself. The name of the first was Aʹdah, and the name of
the second was Zilʹlah. 20 Aʹdah gave birth to Jaʹbal. He was the founder
of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 21 His brother’s name was
Juʹbal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe. 22
Also, Zilʹlah gave birth to Tuʹbal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of
copper and iron. And the sister of Tuʹbal-cain was Naʹa·mah. 23 Then
Laʹmech composed these words for his wives Aʹdah and Zilʹlah:
“Hear my
voice, you wives of Laʹmech;Give ear to my saying:
A man I have killed for
wounding me,Yes, a young man for striking me. 24 If 7 times Cain is to be
avenged,Then Laʹmech 77 times.“ 25 Adam again had sexual relations with his
wife, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth because, as she said,
“God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, because Cain
killed him.“ 26 There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Eʹnosh.
At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah. |5| This is the book
of Adam’s history. In the day that God created Adam, he made him in the
likeness of God. 2 Male and female he created them. On the day they were
created, he blessed them and named them Man. 3 Adam lived for 130 years and
then became father to a son in his likeness, in his image, and he named him
Seth. 4 After becoming father to Seth, Adam lived for 800 years. And he became
father to sons and daughters. 5 So all the days of Adam’s life amounted to
930 years, and then he died. 6 Seth lived for 105 years and then became father
to Eʹnosh. 7 After becoming father to Eʹnosh, Seth lived for 807 years. And

Genesis 5

he became father to sons and daughters. 8 So all the days of Seth amounted to
912 years, and then he died. 9 Eʹnosh lived for 90 years and then became
father to Keʹnan. 10 After becoming father to Keʹnan, Eʹnosh lived for 815
years. And he became father to sons and daughters. 11 So all the days of
Eʹnosh amounted to 905 years, and then he died. 12 Keʹnan lived for 70 years
and then became father to Ma·halʹa·lel. 13 After becoming father to
Ma·halʹa·lel, Keʹnan lived for 840 years. And he became father to sons and
daughters. 14 So all the days of Keʹnan amounted to 910 years, and then he
died. 15 Ma·halʹa·lel lived for 65 years and then became father to Jaʹred.
16 After becoming father to Jaʹred, Ma·halʹa·lel lived for 830 years. And
he became father to sons and daughters. 17 So all the days of Ma·halʹa·lel
amounted to 895 years, and then he died. 18 Jaʹred lived for 162 years and
then became father to Eʹnoch. 19 After becoming father to Eʹnoch, Jaʹred
lived for 800 years. And he became father to sons and daughters. 20 So all the
days of Jaʹred amounted to 962 years, and then he died. 21 Eʹnoch lived for
65 years and then became father to Me·thuʹse·lah. 22 After becoming father
to Me·thuʹse·lah, Eʹnoch continued to walk with the true God for 300
years. And he became father to sons and daughters. 23 So all the days of
Eʹnoch amounted to 365 years. 24 Eʹnoch kept walking with the true God. Then
he was no more, for God took him. 25 Me·thuʹse·lah lived for 187 years and
then became father to Laʹmech. 26 After becoming father to Laʹmech,
Me·thuʹse·lah lived for 782 years. And he became father to sons and
daughters. 27 So all the days of Me·thuʹse·lah amounted to 969 years, and
then he died. 28 Laʹmech lived for 182 years and then became father to a son.
29 He named him Noah, saying: “This one will bring us comfort from our labor
and from the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that Jehovah has
cursed.“ 30 After becoming father to Noah, Laʹmech lived for 595 years. And
he became father to sons and daughters. 31 So all the days of Laʹmech
amounted to 777 years, and then he died. 32 After Noah reached 500 years of
age, he became father to Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. |6| Now when men started to
grow in number on the surface of the ground and daughters were born to them, 2
the sons of the true God began to notice that the daughters of men were
beautiful. So they began taking as wives all whom they chose. 3 Then Jehovah
said: “My spirit will not tolerate man indefinitely, because he is only
flesh. Accordingly, his days will amount to 120 years.“ 4 The Nephʹi·lim
were on the earth in those days and afterward. During that time the sons of
the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men, and these
bore sons to them. They were the mighty ones of old times, the men of fame. 5
Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth and
that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.
6 Jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth, and his heart was
saddened. 7 So Jehovah said: “I am going to wipe men whom I have created off
the surface of the ground, man together with domestic animals, creeping
animals, and flying creatures of the heavens, for I regret that I have made
them.“ 8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah. 9 This is the history
of Noah.
Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his
contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God. 10 In time Noah became father
to three sons, Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. 11 But the earth had become ruined in
the sight of the true God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 Yes, God
looked upon the earth, and it was ruined; all flesh had ruined its way on the
earth. 13 After that God said to Noah: “I have decided to put an end to all
flesh, because the earth is full of violence on account of them, so I am

                                       5

bringing them to ruin together with the earth. 14 Make for yourself an ark
from resinous wood. You will make compartments in the ark and cover it with
tar inside and outside. 15 This is how you will make it: The ark should be 300
cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. 16 You will make a window for
light for the ark, one cubit from the top. You should put the entrance of the
ark in its side and make it with a lower deck, a second deck, and a third
deck. 17 “As for me, I am going to bring floodwaters upon the earth to
destroy from under the heavens all flesh that has the breath of life.
Everything on the earth will perish. 18 And I am establishing my covenant with
you, and you must go into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’
wives with you. 19 And bring into the ark two of every sort of living creature
in order to preserve them alive with you, a male and a female; 20 of the
flying creatures according to their kinds, the domestic animals according to
their kinds, and all creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds,
two of each will go in there to you to preserve them alive. 21 For your part,
you are to collect and take with you every kind of food to eat, to serve as
food for you and for the animals.“ 22 And Noah did according to all that God
had commanded him. He did just so. |7| After that Jehovah said to Noah: “Go
into the ark, you and all your household, because you are the one I have found
to be righteous before me among this generation. 2 You must take with you
every kind of clean animal by sevens, the male and its mate; and of every
animal that is not clean just two, the male and its mate; 3 also of the flying
creatures of the sky by sevens, male and female, to preserve their offspring
alive over all the earth. 4 For in just seven days, I will make it rain on the
earth for 40 days and 40 nights, and I will wipe from the surface of the
ground every living thing that I have made.“ 5 Then Noah did everything that
Jehovah had commanded him. 6 Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came
upon the earth. 7 So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’
wives, went into the ark ahead of the floodwaters. 8 Of every clean animal and
of every animal that is not clean and of the flying creatures and of
everything that moves on the ground, 9 they went inside the ark to Noah by
twos, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah. 10 And seven days later
the floodwaters came upon the earth. 11 In the 600th year of Noah’s life, in
the second month, on the 17th day of the month, on that day all the springs of
the vast watery deep burst open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
12 And the rain poured down on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights. 13 On that
very day, Noah went into the ark along with his sons, Shem, Ham, and
Jaʹpheth, and his wife and the three wives of his sons. 14 They went in with
every wild animal according to its kind, and every domestic animal according
to its kind, and every creeping animal of the earth according to its kind, and
every flying creature according to its kind, every bird, every winged
creature. 15 They kept going to Noah inside the ark, two by two, of every sort
of flesh that has the breath of life. 16 So they went in, male and female of
every sort of flesh, just as God had commanded him. After that Jehovah shut
the door behind him. 17 The flooding continued for 40 days on the earth, and
the waters kept increasing and began carrying the ark, and it was floating
high above the earth. 18 The waters became overwhelming and kept increasing
greatly upon the earth, but the ark floated on the surface of the waters. 19
The waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly that all the tall mountains under
the whole heavens were covered. 20 The waters rose up to 15 cubits above the
mountains. 21 So all living creatures that were moving on the earth
perished—the flying creatures, the domestic animals, the wild animals, the

                                       6

Genesis 7

swarming creatures, and all mankind. 22 Everything on dry land that had the
breath of life in its nostrils died. 23 So He wiped every living thing from
the surface of the earth, including man, animals, creeping animals, and the
flying creatures of the sky. They were all wiped off the earth; only Noah and
those with him in the ark survived. 24 And the waters continued overwhelming
the earth for 150 days. |8| But God gave attention to Noah and to all the wild
animals and domestic animals that were with him in the ark, and God caused a
wind to blow over the earth, and the waters began to subside. 2 The springs of
the watery deep and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up, so the rain
from the heavens stopped falling. 3 Then the waters began to recede
progressively from the earth. By the end of 150 days, the waters had subsided.
4 In the seventh month, on the 17th day of the month, the ark came to rest on
the mountains of Arʹa·rat. 5 And the waters were steadily decreasing until
the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of
the mountains appeared. 6 So at the end of 40 days, Noah opened the window
that he had made in the ark 7 and sent out a raven; it continued flying
outside and returning, until the waters dried off the earth. 8 Later he sent
out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the
ground. 9 The dove did not find any resting-place to perch, so it returned to
him into the ark because the waters were still covering the surface of the
whole earth. So he reached his hand out and brought it inside the ark. 10 He
waited seven more days, and once again he sent out the dove from the ark. 11
When the dove came to him toward evening, he saw that there was a freshly
plucked olive leaf in its bill! So Noah knew that the waters had receded from
the earth. 12 He waited still another seven days. Then he sent out the dove,
but it did not return to him anymore. 13 Now in the 601st year, in the first
month, on the first day of the month, the waters had drained from the earth;
and Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the
ground was drying. 14 In the second month, on the 27th day of the month, the
earth had dried off. 15 God now said to Noah: 16 “Go out of the ark, you,
your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives. 17 Bring out with you all the
living creatures of every sort of flesh, of the flying creatures and of the
animals and of all the creeping animals of the earth, that they may multiply
on the earth and be fruitful and become many on the earth.“ 18 So Noah went
out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives. 19 Every living
creature, every creeping animal and every flying creature, everything that
moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families. 20 Then Noah built an
altar to Jehovah and took some of all the clean animals and of all the clean
flying creatures and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And Jehovah
began to smell a pleasing aroma. So Jehovah said in his heart: “Never again
will I curse the ground on man’s account, for the inclination of the heart
of man is bad from his youth up; and never again will I strike down every
living thing as I have done. 22 From now on, the earth will never cease to
have seed-sowing and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and
night.“ |9| God went on to bless Noah and his sons and to say to them: “Be
fruitful and become many and fill the earth. 2 A fear of you and a terror of
you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every
flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the ground and
upon all the fish of the sea. They are now given into your hand. 3 Every
moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. Just as I gave you the
green vegetation, I give them all to you. 4 Only flesh with its life—its
blood—you must not eat. 5 Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your

Genesis 9

lifeblood. I will demand an accounting from every living creature; and from
each man I will demand an accounting for the life of his brother. 6 Anyone
shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s
image He made man. 7 As for you, be fruitful and become many, and increase
abundantly on the earth and multiply.“ 8 Then God said to Noah and to his
sons with him: 9 “I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your
offspring after you, 10 and with every living creature that is with you, the
birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all
those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth. 11 Yes, I
establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the
waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.“ 12
And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me
and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future
generations. 13 I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of
the covenant between me and the earth. 14 Whenever I bring a cloud over the
earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud. 15 And I will
certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living
creature of every kind; and never again will the waters become a flood to
destroy all flesh. 16 And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will
certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every
living creature of every kind on the earth.“ 17 God repeated to Noah:
“This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh
that is on the earth.“ 18 Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem,
Ham, and Jaʹpheth. Ham later became the father of Caʹnaan. 19 These three
were Noah’s sons, and all the earth’s population came from them and spread
abroad. 20 Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard. 21
When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself
inside his tent. 22 Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness,
and he told his two brothers outside. 23 So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment
and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered
their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did
not see their father’s nakedness. 24 When Noah woke up from his wine and
learned what his youngest son had done to him, 25 he said:
“Cursed be
Caʹnaan.
Let him become the lowest slave to his brothers.“ 26 And he
added:
“Praised be Jehovah, the God of Shem,And let Caʹnaan become a slave
to him. 27 Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth,And let him reside in the
tents of Shem.
Let Caʹnaan become a slave to him also.“ 28 Noah continued
to live for 350 years after the Flood. 29 So all the days of Noah amounted to
950 years, and he died. |10| This is the history of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham,
and Jaʹpheth.
Sons were born to them after the Flood. 2 The sons of Jaʹpheth
were Goʹmer, Maʹgog, Maʹda·i, Jaʹvan, Tuʹbal, Meʹshech, and Tiʹras. 3
The sons of Goʹmer were Ashʹke·naz, Riʹphath, and To·garʹmah. 4 The sons
of Jaʹvan were E·liʹshah, Tarʹshish, Kitʹtim, and Doʹda·nim. 5 From
these the inhabitants of the islands spread into their lands, according to
their languages and their families and by their nations. 6 The sons of Ham
were Cush, Mizʹra·im, Put, and Caʹnaan. 7 The sons of Cush were Seʹba,
Havʹi·lah, Sabʹtah, Raʹa·mah, and Sabʹte·ca.
The sons of Raʹa·mah
were Sheʹba and Deʹdan. 8 Cush became father to Nimʹrod. He was the first
to become a mighty one on the earth. 9 He became a mighty hunter in opposition
to Jehovah. That is why there is a saying: “Just like Nimʹrod, a mighty
hunter in opposition to Jehovah.“ 10 The beginning of his kingdom was
Baʹbel, Eʹrech, Acʹcad, and Calʹneh, in the land of Shiʹnar. 11 From that

land he went into As·syrʹi·a and built Ninʹe·veh, Re·hoʹboth-Ir,
Caʹlah, 12 and Reʹsen, between Ninʹe·veh and Caʹlah: This is the great
city. 13 Mizʹra·im became father to Luʹdim, Anʹa·mim, Le·haʹbim,
Naph·tuʹhim, 14 Path·ruʹsim, Cas·luʹhim (from whom the Phi·lisʹtines
came), and Caphʹto·rim. 15 Caʹnaan became father to Siʹdon, his firstborn,
and Heth, 16 as well as the Jebʹu·site, the Amʹor·ite, the Girʹga·shite,
17 the Hiʹvite, the Arkʹite, the Siʹnite, 18 the Arʹvad·ite, the
Zemʹa·rite, and the Haʹmath·ite. Afterward, the families of the
Caʹnaan·ites were scattered. 19 So the boundary of the Caʹnaan·ites was
from Siʹdon as far as Geʹrar, near Gazʹa, as far as Sodʹom, Go·morʹrah,
Adʹmah, and Ze·boiʹim, near Laʹsha. 20 These were the sons of Ham
according to their families and their languages, by their lands and their
nations. 21 Children were also born to Shem, the forefather of all the sons of
Eʹber and the brother of Jaʹpheth the oldest. 22 The sons of Shem were
Eʹlam, Asʹshur, Ar·pachʹshad, Lud, and Aʹram. 23 The sons of Aʹram were
Uz, Hul, Geʹther, and Mash. 24 Ar·pachʹshad became father to Sheʹlah, and
Sheʹlah became father to Eʹber. 25 Two sons were born to Eʹber. The name of
the one was Peʹleg, because in his lifetime the earth was divided. The name
of his brother was Jokʹtan. 26 Jokʹtan became father to Al·moʹdad,
Sheʹleph, Ha·zar·maʹveth, Jeʹrah, 27 Ha·doʹram, Uʹzal, Dikʹlah, 28
Oʹbal, A·bimʹa·el, Sheʹba, 29 Oʹphir, Havʹi·lah, and Joʹbab; all of
these were the sons of Jokʹtan. 30 Their place of dwelling extended from
Meʹsha as far as Seʹphar, the mountainous region of the East. 31 These were
the sons of Shem according to their families and their languages, by their
lands and their nations. 32 These were the families of the sons of Noah
according to their family lines and by their nations. From these the nations
were spread abroad in the earth after the Flood. |11| Now all the earth
continued to be of one language and of one set of words. 2 As they traveled
eastward, they discovered a valley plain in the land of Shiʹnar, and they
began dwelling there. 3 Then they said to one another: “Come! Let us make
bricks and bake them with fire.“ So they used bricks instead of stone, and
bitumen as mortar. 4 They now said: “Come! Let us build a city for ourselves
and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for
ourselves, so that we will not be scattered over the entire face of the
earth.“ 5 Then Jehovah went down to see the city and the tower that the sons
of men had built. 6 Jehovah then said: “Look! They are one people with one
language, and this is what they have started to do. Now there is nothing that
they may have in mind to do that will be impossible for them. 7 Come! Let us
go down there and confuse their language in order that they may not understand
one another’s language.“ 8 So Jehovah scattered them from there over the
entire face of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city. 9
That is why it was named Baʹbel, because there Jehovah confused the language
of all the earth, and Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face
of the earth. 10 This is the history of Shem.
Shem was 100 years old when he
became father to Ar·pachʹshad two years after the Flood. 11 After becoming
father to Ar·pachʹshad, Shem continued to live 500 years. And he became
father to sons and daughters. 12 Ar·pachʹshad lived for 35 years and then
became father to Sheʹlah. 13 After becoming father to Sheʹlah,
Ar·pachʹshad continued to live 403 years. And he became father to sons and
daughters. 14 Sheʹlah lived for 30 years and then became father to Eʹber. 15
After becoming father to Eʹber, Sheʹlah continued to live 403 years. And he
became father to sons and daughters. 16 Eʹber lived for 34 years and then

Genesis 11

became father to Peʹleg. 17 After becoming father to Peʹleg, Eʹber
continued to live 430 years. And he became father to sons and daughters. 18
Peʹleg lived for 30 years and then became father to Reʹu. 19 After becoming
father to Reʹu, Peʹleg continued to live 209 years. And he became father to
sons and daughters. 20 Reʹu lived for 32 years and then became father to
Seʹrug. 21 After becoming father to Seʹrug, Reʹu continued to live 207
years. And he became father to sons and daughters. 22 Seʹrug lived for 30
years and then became father to Naʹhor. 23 After becoming father to Naʹhor,
Seʹrug continued to live 200 years. And he became father to sons and
daughters. 24 Naʹhor lived for 29 years and then became father to Teʹrah. 25
After becoming father to Teʹrah, Naʹhor continued to live 119 years. And he
became father to sons and daughters. 26 Teʹrah lived for 70 years, after
which he became father to Aʹbram, Naʹhor, and Haʹran. 27 This is the
history of Teʹrah.
Teʹrah became father to Aʹbram, Naʹhor, and Haʹran;
and Haʹran became father to Lot. 28 While his father Teʹrah was still alive,
Haʹran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chal·deʹans. 29 Aʹbram
and Naʹhor took wives for themselves. The name of Aʹbram’s wife was
Sarʹai, and the name of Naʹhor’s wife was Milʹcah, the daughter of
Haʹran, the father of Milʹcah and Isʹcah. 30 Now Sarʹai was barren; she
had no child. 31 Teʹrah then took Aʹbram his son and Lot his grandson, the
son of Haʹran, and Sarʹai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Aʹbram his son,
and they went with him out of Ur of the Chal·deʹans to go to the land of
Caʹnaan. In time they came to Haʹran and began dwelling there. 32 The days
of Teʹrah were 205 years. Then Teʹrah died in Haʹran. |12| And Jehovah said
to Aʹbram: “Go out from your land and away from your relatives and from the
house of your father to the land that I will show you. 2 I will make you a
great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you
will become a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse
him who calls down evil on you, and all the families of the ground will
certainly be blessed by means of you.“ 4 So Aʹbram went just as Jehovah had
told him, and Lot went with him. Aʹbram was 75 years old when he left
Haʹran. 5 Aʹbram took his wife Sarʹai and Lot the son of his brother and
all the goods that they had accumulated and the people whom they had acquired
in Haʹran, and they set out for the land of Caʹnaan. When they reached the
land of Caʹnaan, 6 Aʹbram traveled through the land as far as the site of
Sheʹchem, near the big trees of Moʹreh. At that time the Caʹnaan·ites were
in the land. 7 Jehovah then appeared to Aʹbram and said: “To your offspring
I am going to give this land.“ So he built an altar there to Jehovah, who
had appeared to him. 8 Later he moved from there to the mountainous region
east of Bethʹel and pitched his tent with Bethʹel on the west and Aʹi on
the east. There he built an altar to Jehovah and began to call on the name of
Jehovah. 9 Afterward, Aʹbram broke camp and journeyed toward the Negʹeb,
moving his camp from one place to another. 10 Now a famine arose in the land,
and Aʹbram went down toward Egypt to reside there for a while, because the
famine in the land was severe. 11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to
his wife Sarʹai: “Please listen! I know what a beautiful woman you are. 12
So when the Egyptians see you, they will surely say, ‘This is his wife.’
Then they will kill me but keep you alive. 13 Please say you are my sister, so
that it may go well with me because of you, and my life will be spared.“ 14
As soon as Aʹbram entered Egypt, the Egyptians noticed that the woman was
very beautiful. 15 And the princes of Pharʹaoh also saw her, and they began
praising her to Pharʹaoh, so that the woman was taken to the house of

                                       10

Genesis 12

Pharʹaoh. 16 He treated Aʹbram well because of her, and he acquired sheep,
cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels. 17 Then
Jehovah struck Pharʹaoh and his household with severe plagues because of
Sarʹai, Aʹbram’s wife. 18 So Pharʹaoh called Aʹbram and said: “What is
this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 19
Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I was about to take her as my
wife? Here is your wife. Take her and go!“ 20 So Pharʹaoh gave his men
orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he
had. |13| Aʹbram then went up out of Egypt to the Negʹeb, he and his wife
and all that he had, together with Lot. 2 Aʹbram was very rich in livestock,
silver, and gold. 3 He camped in one place after another as he traveled from
the Negʹeb to Bethʹel, until he arrived at the place where his tent had been
between Bethʹel and Aʹi, 4 to the place where he had previously built an
altar. There Aʹbram called on the name of Jehovah. 5 Now Lot, who was
traveling with Aʹbram, also owned sheep, cattle, and tents. 6 So the land did
not allow for all of them to stay in the same place; their goods had become so
many that they could no longer dwell together. 7 As a result, a quarrel arose
between the herders of Aʹbram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s
livestock. (At that time the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites were
dwelling in the land.) 8 So Aʹbram said to Lot: “Please, there should be no
quarreling between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for
we are brothers. 9 Is not the whole land available to you? Please, separate
from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to
the right, then I will go to the left.“ 10 So Lot raised his eyes and saw
that the whole district of the Jordan was a well-watered region (before
Jehovah destroyed Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah), like the garden of Jehovah, like
the land of Egypt, as far as Zoʹar. 11 Then Lot chose for himself the whole
district of the Jordan, and Lot moved his camp to the east. So they separated
from each other. 12 Aʹbram lived in the land of Caʹnaan, but Lot lived among
the cities of the district. Finally he set up his tent near Sodʹom. 13 Now
the men of Sodʹom were wicked, gross sinners against Jehovah. 14 Jehovah said
to Aʹbram, after Lot had separated from him: “Raise your eyes, please, and
look from the place where you are, to the north and south, east and west, 15
because all the land that you see, I will give to you and your offspring as a
lasting possession. 16 And I will make your offspring like the dust particles
of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust particles of the earth,
then your offspring could be counted. 17 Get up, travel through the length and
breadth of the land, for to you I am going to give it.“ 18 So Aʹbram
continued to live in tents. Later he came and dwelled among the big trees of
Mamʹre, which are in Hebʹron, and there he built an altar to Jehovah. |14|
Now in the days of Amʹra·phel king of Shiʹnar, Arʹi·och king of
El·laʹsar, Ched·or·la·oʹmer king of Eʹlam, and Tiʹdal king of Goiʹim,
2 these made war with Beʹra king of Sodʹom, Birʹsha king of Go·morʹrah,
Shiʹnab king of Adʹmah, Shem·eʹber king of Ze·boiʹim, and the king of
Beʹla, that is, Zoʹar. 3 All of these joined forces at the Valley of
Sidʹdim, that is, the Salt Sea. 4 They had served Ched·or·la·oʹmer for 12
years, but they rebelled in the 13th year. 5 So in the 14th year,
Ched·or·la·oʹmer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the
Rephʹa·im in Ashʹte·roth-kar·naʹim, the Zuʹzim in Ham, the Eʹmim in
Shaʹveh-kir·i·a·thaʹim, 6 and the Horʹites in their mountain of Seʹir
down to El-paʹran, which is at the wilderness. 7 Then they turned back and
came to En-mishʹpat, that is, Kaʹdesh, and conquered the whole territory of

                                       11

Genesis 14

the A·malʹek·ites and also the Amʹor·ites who were dwelling in
Hazʹa·zon-taʹmar. 8 At this point, the king of Sodʹom went on the march,
and also the king of Go·morʹrah, the king of Adʹmah, the king of
Ze·boiʹim, and the king of Beʹla, that is, Zoʹar, and they drew up in
battle formation against them in the Valley of Sidʹdim, 9 against
Ched·or·la·oʹmer king of Eʹlam, Tiʹdal king of Goiʹim, Amʹra·phel
king of Shiʹnar, and Arʹi·och king of El·laʹsar—four kings against the
five. 10 Now the Valley of Sidʹdim was full of bitumen pits, and the kings of
Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah tried to escape and fell into them, and those who
remained fled to the mountainous region. 11 Then the victors took all the
goods of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and all their food and went on their way. 12
They also took Lot, the son of Aʹbram’s brother who was dwelling in
Sodʹom, as well as his goods, and they continued on their way. 13 After that
a man who had escaped came and told Aʹbram the Hebrew. He was then dwelling
among the big trees of Mamʹre the Amʹor·ite, the brother of Eshʹcol and
Aʹner. These men were allies of Aʹbram. 14 Thus Aʹbram heard that his
relative had been taken captive. With that he mobilized his trained men, 318
servants born in his household, and went in pursuit up to Dan. 15 During the
night, he divided his forces, and he and his servants attacked and defeated
them. And he pursued them up to Hoʹbah, which is north of Damascus. 16 He
recovered all the goods, and he also recovered Lot his relative, his goods,
the women, and the other people. 17 After Aʹbram returned from defeating
Ched·or·la·oʹmer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodʹom went
out to meet Aʹbram at the Valley of Shaʹveh, that is, the Valley of the
King. 18 And Mel·chizʹe·dek king of Saʹlem brought out bread and wine; he
was priest of the Most High God. 19 Then he blessed him and said:
“Blessed
be Aʹbram by the Most High God,Maker of heaven and earth; 20 And praised be
the Most High God,Who has handed your oppressors over to you!“
And Aʹbram
gave him a tenth of everything. 21 After that the king of Sodʹom said to
Aʹbram: “Give me the people, but take the goods for yourself.“ 22 But
Aʹbram said to the king of Sodʹom: “I raise my hand in an oath to Jehovah
the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth, 23 that I will not take anything
that is yours, from a thread to a sandal lace, so that you may not say, ‘I
made Aʹbram rich.’ 24 I will take nothing except what the young men have
already eaten. As for the share of the men who went with me, Aʹner, Eshʹcol,
and Mamʹre—let them take their share.“ |15| After this the word of
Jehovah came to Aʹbram in a vision, saying: “Do not fear, Aʹbram. I am a
shield for you. Your reward will be very great.“ 2 Aʹbram replied:
“Sovereign Lord Jehovah, what will you give me, seeing that I continue
childless and the one who will inherit my house is a man of Damascus,
E·li·eʹzer?“ 3 Aʹbram added: “You have given me no offspring, and a
member of my household is succeeding me as heir.“ 4 But look! Jehovah’s
word in reply to him was, “This man will not succeed you as heir, but your
own son will succeed you as heir.“ 5 He now brought him outside and said:
“Look up, please, to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to do
so.“ Then he said to him: “So your offspring will become.“ 6 And he put
faith in Jehovah, and He counted it to him as righteousness. 7 Then he added:
“I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chal·deʹans to give you
this land as your possession.“ 8 To this he said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah,
how will I know that I will take possession of it?“ 9 He replied to him:
“Take for me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a
three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.“ 10 So he took all of

                                       12

Genesis 15

these and cut them in two and put each part opposite the other, but he did not
cut up the birds. 11 Then the birds of prey began to descend on the carcasses,
but Aʹbram kept driving them away. 12 When the sun was about to set, a deep
sleep fell upon Aʹbram and a great and frightening darkness descended on him.
13 Then He said to Aʹbram: “Know for certain that your offspring will be
foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them
and afflict them for 400 years. 14 But I will judge the nation they will
serve, and after that they will go out with many goods. 15 As for you, you
will go to your forefathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. 16
But they will return here in the fourth generation, because the error of the
Amʹor·ites has not yet reached its full measure.“ 17 When the sun had set
and it had become very dark, a smoking furnace appeared, and a fiery torch
passed between the pieces. 18 On that day Jehovah made with Aʹbram a
covenant, saying: “To your offspring I will give this land, from the river
of Egypt to the great river, the river Eu·phraʹtes: 19 the land of the
Kenʹites, the Kenʹiz·zites, the Kadʹmon·ites, 20 the Hitʹtites, the
Perʹiz·zites, the Rephʹa·im, 21 the Amʹor·ites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the
Girʹga·shites, and the Jebʹu·sites.“ |16| Now Aʹbram’s wife Sarʹai
had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian servant whose name was
Haʹgar. 2 So Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “Please now! Jehovah has prevented me
from bearing children. Please, have relations with my servant. Perhaps I can
have children by means of her.“ So Aʹbram listened to what Sarʹai said. 3
After Aʹbram had lived for ten years in the land of Caʹnaan, Aʹbram’s
wife Sarʹai took her Egyptian servant Haʹgar and gave her to her husband
Aʹbram as his wife. 4 So he had relations with Haʹgar, and she became
pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her
mistress. 5 At this Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “The injury done to me is your
fault. I was the one who put my servant in your arms, but when she realized
that she was pregnant, she began to despise me. May Jehovah judge between me
and you.“ 6 So Aʹbram said to Sarʹai: “Look! Your servant is under your
authority. Do to her whatever you think is best.“ Then Sarʹai humiliated
her, and she ran away from her. 7 Later Jehovah’s angel found her at a
spring of waters in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. 8 And he
said: “Haʹgar, servant of Sarʹai, where have you come from and where are
you going?“ To this she said: “I am running away from my mistress
Sarʹai.“ 9 Jehovah’s angel then said to her: “Return to your mistress
and humble yourself under her hand.“ 10 Then Jehovah’s angel said: “I
will greatly multiply your offspring, so that they will be too numerous to
count.“ 11 Jehovah’s angel added: “Here you are pregnant, and you will
give birth to a son, and you must name him Ishʹma·el, for Jehovah has heard
your affliction. 12 He will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be
against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him, and he will dwell
opposite all his brothers.“ 13 Then she called on the name of Jehovah, who
was speaking to her: “You are a God of sight,“ for she said: “Have I
here actually looked upon the one who sees me?“ 14 That is why the well was
called Beʹer-laʹhai-roi. (It is between Kaʹdesh and Beʹred.) 15 So Haʹgar
bore to Aʹbram a son, and Aʹbram named his son, whom Haʹgar bore,
Ishʹma·el. 16 Aʹbram was 86 years old when Haʹgar bore Ishʹma·el to him.
|17| When Aʹbram was 99 years old, Jehovah appeared to Aʹbram and said to
him: “I am God Almighty. Walk before me and prove yourself faultless. 2 I
will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you very,
very much.“ 3 At this Aʹbram fell facedown, and God continued to speak with

                                       13

Genesis 17

him, saying: 4 “As for me, look! my covenant is with you, and you will
certainly become a father of many nations. 5 Your name will no longer be
Aʹbram; your name will become Abraham, for I will make you a father of many
nations. 6 I will make you very, very fruitful and will make you become
nations, and kings will come from you. 7 “And I will keep my covenant
between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations
for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
8 And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land in which you
lived as a foreigner—the entire land of Caʹnaan—for a lasting possession,
and I will be their God.“ 9 God said further to Abraham: “As for you, you
are to keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their
generations. 10 This is my covenant between me and you, that you and your
offspring after you will keep: Every male among you must get circumcised. 11
You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it will serve as a sign
of the covenant between me and you. 12 Throughout your generations, every male
among you eight days old must be circumcised, anyone who is born in the house
and anyone who is not one of your offspring and who was purchased with money
from a foreigner. 13 Every man born in your house and every man purchased with
your money must be circumcised, and my covenant in your flesh must serve as a
lasting covenant. 14 If any uncircumcised male will not circumcise the flesh
of his foreskin, that person must be cut off from his people. He has broken my
covenant.“ 15 Then God said to Abraham: “As for your wife Sarʹai, you
must not call her Sarʹai, because Sarah will become her name. 16 I will bless
her and also give you a son by her; I will bless her and she will become
nations; kings of peoples will come from her.“ 17 At this Abraham fell
facedown and began to laugh and to say in his heart: “Will a man 100 years
old have a child born to him, and will Sarah, a woman 90 years old, give
birth?“ 18 So Abraham said to the true God: “O that Ishʹma·el might live
before you!“ 19 To this God said: “Your wife Sarah will definitely bear
you a son, and you must name him Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with
him for an everlasting covenant to his offspring after him. 20 But as regards
Ishʹma·el, I have heard you. Look! I will bless him and will make him
fruitful and will multiply him very, very much. He will produce 12 chieftains,
and I will make him become a great nation. 21 However, I will establish my
covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this appointed time next
year.“ 22 When God finished speaking with him, he went up from Abraham. 23
Abraham then took Ishʹma·el his son and all the men born in his house and
everyone he had purchased with money, every male in the household of Abraham,
and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that very day, just as God
had spoken with him. 24 Abraham was 99 years old when he had the flesh of his
foreskin circumcised. 25 And Ishʹma·el his son was 13 years old when he had
the flesh of his foreskin circumcised. 26 On that very day, Abraham was
circumcised and also his son Ishʹma·el. 27 All the men of his household,
anyone born in the house and anyone purchased with money from a foreigner,
were also circumcised with him. |18| Afterward, Jehovah appeared to him among
the big trees of Mamʹre while he was sitting at the entrance of the tent
during the hottest part of the day. 2 He looked up and saw three men standing
some distance from him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent
to meet them, and he bowed down to the ground. 3 Then he said: “Jehovah, if
I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant. 4 Please,
let a little water be brought and have your feet washed; then recline under
the tree. 5 Seeing that you have come here to your servant, let me bring a

Genesis 18

piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves. Then you may go on your
way.“ At this they said: “All right. You may do as you have spoken.“ 6
So Abraham hurried to the tent to Sarah and said: “Quick! Get three measures
of fine flour, knead the dough, and make loaves of bread.“ 7 Next Abraham
ran to the herd and chose a tender and good young bull. He gave it to the
attendant, who hurried to prepare it. 8 He then took butter and milk and the
young bull that he had prepared and set the food before them. Then he stood by
them under the tree as they were eating. 9 They said to him: “Where is your
wife Sarah?“ He replied: “Here in the tent.“ 10 So one of them
continued: “I will surely return to you next year at this time, and look!
your wife Sarah will have a son.“ Now Sarah was listening at the tent
entrance, which was behind the man. 11 Abraham and Sarah were old, being
advanced in years. Sarah was past the age of childbearing. 12 So Sarah began
to laugh to herself, saying: “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I
really have this pleasure?“ 13 Then Jehovah said to Abraham: “Why did
Sarah laugh and say, ‘Am I really going to give birth even though I am
old?’ 14 Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah? I will return to you
next year at this appointed time, and Sarah will have a son.“ 15 But Sarah
denied it, saying, “I did not laugh!“ for she was afraid. At this he said:
“Yes! You did laugh.“ 16 When the men got up to leave and looked down
toward Sodʹom, Abraham was walking with them to escort them. 17 Jehovah said:
“Am I keeping hidden from Abraham what I am going to do? 18 Why, Abraham is
surely going to become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the
earth will be blessed by means of him. 19 For I have come to know him in order
that he may command his sons and his household after him to keep Jehovah’s
way by doing what is right and just, so that Jehovah may bring about what he
has promised concerning Abraham.“ 20 Then Jehovah said: “The outcry
against Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah is indeed great, and their sin is very heavy.
21 I will go down to see whether they are acting according to the outcry that
has reached me. And if not, I can get to know it.“ 22 Then the men left from
there and went toward Sodʹom, but Jehovah remained with Abraham. 23 Then
Abraham approached and said: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with
the wicked? 24 Suppose there are 50 righteous men within the city. Will you,
then, sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the 50
righteous who are inside it? 25 It is unthinkable that you would act in this
manner by putting the righteous man to death with the wicked one so that the
outcome for the righteous man and the wicked is the same! It is unthinkable of
you. Will the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?“ 26 Then Jehovah
said: “If I find in Sodʹom 50 righteous men in the city, I will pardon the
whole place for their sake.“ 27 But Abraham again responded: “Please, here
I have presumed to speak to Jehovah, whereas I am dust and ashes. 28 Suppose
the 50 righteous should lack five. Because of the five will you destroy the
whole city?“ To this he said: “I will not destroy it if I find there
45.“ 29 But yet again he spoke to him and said: “Suppose 40 are found
there.“ He answered: “I will not do it for the sake of the 40.“ 30 But
he continued: “Jehovah, please, do not become hot with anger, but let me go
on speaking: Suppose only 30 are found there.“ He answered: “I will not do
it if I find 30 there.“ 31 But he continued: “Please, here I have presumed
to speak to Jehovah: Suppose only 20 are found there.“ He answered: “I
will not destroy it for the sake of the 20.“ 32 Finally he said: “Jehovah,
please, do not become hot with anger, but let me speak just once more: Suppose
only ten are found there.“ He answered: “I will not destroy it for the

                                       15

Genesis 18

sake of the ten.“ 33 When Jehovah finished speaking to Abraham, he went his
way and Abraham returned to his place. |19| The two angels arrived at Sodʹom
by evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodʹom. When Lot saw them, he
got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the earth. 2 And he said:
“Please, my lords, turn aside, please, into the house of your servant and
stay overnight and have your feet washed. Then you may get up early and travel
on your way.“ To this they said: “No, we will stay overnight in the public
square.“ 3 But he was so insistent with them that they went with him to his
house. Then he made a feast for them, and he baked unleavened bread, and they
ate. 4 Before they could lie down to sleep, the men of the city—the men of
Sodʹom from boy to old man, all of them—surrounded the house in one mob. 5
And they kept calling out to Lot and saying to him: “Where are the men who
came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may have sex with
them.“ 6 Then Lot went out to them to the doorway, and he shut the door
behind him. 7 He said: “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. 8 Please,
here I have two daughters who have never had sexual relations with a man.
Please, let me bring them out to you for you to do to them whatever seems good
to you. But do not do anything to these men, for they have come under the
shelter of my roof.“ 9 At this they said: “Stand back!“ And they added:
“This lone foreigner came to live here, and yet he dares to judge us! Now we
are going to do worse to you than to them.“ And they crowded in on Lot and
moved forward to break down the door. 10 So the men reached out their hands
and brought Lot into the house with them, and they shut the door. 11 But they
struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the
least to the greatest, so that they wore themselves out trying to find the
doorway. 12 Then the men said to Lot: “Do you have anyone else here?
Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and all your people in the city, bring
out of this place! 13 For we are going to destroy this place, because the
outcry against them has indeed grown great before Jehovah, so that Jehovah
sent us to destroy the city.“ 14 So Lot went out and began to speak to his
sons-in-law who were to marry his daughters, and he kept saying: “Get up!
Get out of this place, because Jehovah will destroy the city!“ But to his
sons-in-law, he seemed to be joking. 15 As dawn was breaking, the angels
became urgent with Lot, saying: “Get up! Take your wife and your two
daughters who are here with you, so that you will not be swept away in the
error of the city!“ 16 When he kept lingering, then because of Jehovah’s
compassion for him, the men seized hold of his hand and the hand of his wife
and the hands of his two daughters, and they brought him out and stationed him
outside the city. 17 As soon as they had brought them to the outskirts, he
said: “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you and do not stand still
in any part of the district! Escape to the mountainous region so that you may
not be swept away!“ 18 Then Lot said to them: “Not there, please, Jehovah!
19 Please, now, your servant has found favor in your eyes and you are showing
great kindness to me by preserving me alive, but I am not able to flee to the
mountainous region because I am afraid that disaster may overtake me and I
will die. 20 Please, now, this town is nearby and I can flee there; it is only
a small place. May I, please, escape there? It is only a small place. Then I
will survive.“ 21 So he said to him: “Very well, I will also show you
consideration by not overthrowing the town you speak of. 22 Hurry! Escape
there, because I cannot do anything until you arrive there!“ That is why he
named the town Zoʹar. 23 The sun had risen over the land when Lot arrived at
Zoʹar. 24 Then Jehovah made it rain sulfur and fire on Sodʹom and

                                       16

Genesis 19

Go·morʹrah—it came from Jehovah, from the heavens. 25 So he overthrew
these cities, yes, the entire district, including all the inhabitants of the
cities and the plants of the ground. 26 But Lot’s wife, who was behind him,
began to look back, and she became a pillar of salt. 27 Now Abraham got up
early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah. 
28 When he looked down toward Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and all the land of the
district, he saw quite a sight. There was dense smoke rising from the land
like the dense smoke of a kiln! 29 So when God destroyed the cities of the
district, God kept Abraham in mind by sending Lot out from the cities he
overthrew, the cities where Lot had been dwelling. 30 Later Lot went up from
Zoʹar with his two daughters and began living in the mountainous region,
because he was afraid to live in Zoʹar. So he began living in a cave with his
two daughters. 31 And the firstborn said to the younger: “Our father is old,
and there is not a man in the land to have relations with us according to the
custom of the whole earth. 32 Come, let us give our father wine to drink, and
let us lie down with him and preserve offspring from our father.“ 33 So that
night they kept giving their father wine to drink; then the firstborn went in
and lay down with her father, but he did not know when she lay down and when
she got up. 34 Then on the next day, the firstborn said to the younger:
“Here I lay down with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink
tonight also. Then you go in and lie down with him, and let us preserve
offspring from our father.“ 35 So that night also, they repeatedly gave
their father wine to drink; then the younger went and lay down with him, but
he did not know when she lay down and when she got up. 36 So both daughters of
Lot became pregnant by their father. 37 The firstborn gave birth to a son and
named him Moʹab. He is the father of the Moʹab·ites of today. 38 The
younger also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-amʹmi. He is the
father of the Amʹmon·ites of today. |20| Now Abraham moved his camp from
there to the land of the Negʹeb and began dwelling between Kaʹdesh and Shur.
While he was residing at Geʹrar, 2 Abraham repeated concerning his wife
Sarah: “She is my sister.“ So A·bimʹe·lech king of Geʹrar sent for
Sarah and took her. 3 Afterward, God came by night to A·bimʹe·lech in a
dream and said to him: “Here you are as good as dead because of the woman
whom you have taken, since she is married and belongs to another man.“ 4
However, A·bimʹe·lech had not gone near her. So he said: “Jehovah, will
you kill a nation that is really innocent? 5 Did he not say to me, ‘She is
my sister,’ and did she too not say, ‘He is my brother’? I did this with
an honest heart and innocent hands.“ 6 Then the true God said to him in the
dream: “I know that you did this with an honest heart, so I held you back
from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her. 7 Now
return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication
for you and you will keep living. But if you are not returning her, know that
you will surely die, you and all who are yours.“ 8 A·bimʹe·lech got up
early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these
things, and they became very frightened. 9 Then A·bimʹe·lech called Abraham
and said to him: “What have you done to us? What sin have I committed
against you that you would bring upon me and my kingdom such a great sin? What
you have done to me was not right.“ 10 And A·bimʹe·lech went on to say to
Abraham: “What were your intentions when you did this thing?“ 11 Abraham
said: “It was because I said to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in
this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ 12 And besides, she
really is my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my

                                       17

Genesis 20

mother, and she became my wife. 13 So when God caused me to wander from the
house of my father, I said to her: ‘Let this be how you show loyal love to
me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.“’“ 14
A·bimʹe·lech then took sheep and cattle and male and female servants and
gave them to Abraham, and he returned his wife Sarah to him. 15
A·bimʹe·lech also said: “Here my land is available to you. Dwell wherever
you please.“ 16 And to Sarah he said: “Here I give 1,000 pieces of silver
to your brother. It is a sign of your innocence to all who are with you and
before everybody, and you are cleared of reproach.“ 17 And Abraham began to
make supplication to the true God, and God healed A·bimʹe·lech and his wife
and his slave girls, and they began having children; 18 for Jehovah had made
all the women of the house of A·bimʹe·lech barren because of Sarah,
Abraham’s wife. |21| Jehovah turned his attention to Sarah just as he had
said, and Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised. 2 So Sarah became
pregnant and then bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the appointed time
God had promised him. 3 Abraham named his newborn son, whom Sarah bore to him,
Isaac. 4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old,
just as God had commanded him. 5 Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac
was born to him. 6 Then Sarah said: “God has brought me laughter; everybody
hearing of it will laugh with me.“ 7 And she added: “Who would have said
to Abraham, ‘Sarah will certainly nurse children’? Yet, I have given birth
to a son for him in his old age.“ 8 Now the child grew and was weaned, and
Abraham prepared a big feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 9 But Sarah
kept noticing that the son of Haʹgar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to
Abraham, was mocking Isaac. 10 So she said to Abraham: “Drive out this slave
girl and her son, for the son of this slave girl is not going to be an heir
along with my son, with Isaac!“ 11 But what she said about his son was very
displeasing to Abraham. 12 Then God said to Abraham: “Do not be displeased
by what Sarah is saying to you about the boy and about your slave girl. Listen
to her, for what will be called your offspring will be through Isaac. 13 As
for the son of the slave girl, I will also make a nation out of him, because
he is your offspring.“ 14 So Abraham got up early in the morning and took
bread and a skin bottle of water and gave it to Haʹgar. He set these on her
shoulder and then sent her away along with the boy. So she departed and
wandered about in the wilderness of Beʹer-sheʹba. 15 Finally the water in
the skin bottle was used up, and she pushed the boy under one of the bushes. 
16 Then she went on and sat down by herself, about the distance of a bowshot
away, because she said: “I do not want to watch the boy die.“ So she sat
down at a distance and began to cry aloud and to weep. 17 At that God heard
the voice of the boy, and God’s angel called to Haʹgar from the heavens and
said to her: “What is the matter with you, Haʹgar? Do not be afraid, for
God has heard the voice of the boy there where he is. 18 Get up, lift the boy
and take hold of him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.“ 19
Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled
the skin bottle with water and gave the boy a drink. 20 And God was with the
boy as he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer. 21 He took
up dwelling in the wilderness of Paʹran, and his mother took a wife for him
from the land of Egypt. 22 At that time A·bimʹe·lech together with Phiʹcol
the chief of his army said to Abraham: “God is with you in everything you
are doing. 23 So now swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely
with me and with my offspring and with my descendants, and that you will deal
with me and with the land where you have been residing with the same loyal

                                       18

Genesis 21

love that I have shown you.“ 24 So Abraham said: “I swear to this.“ 25
However, Abraham complained to A·bimʹe·lech about the well of water that
the servants of A·bimʹe·lech had violently seized. 26 A·bimʹe·lech
replied: “I do not know who did this; you did not tell me about it, and I
heard nothing about it until today.“ 27 At that Abraham took sheep and
cattle and gave them to A·bimʹe·lech, and the two of them made a covenant. 
28 When Abraham set seven female lambs apart from the flock by themselves, 29
A·bimʹe·lech said to Abraham: “Why have you set these seven female lambs
here by themselves?“ 30 Then he said: “You are to accept the seven female
lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.“ 31 That is why he
called that place Beʹer-sheʹba, because there both of them had taken an
oath. 32 So they made a covenant at Beʹer-sheʹba, after which
A·bimʹe·lech got up together with Phiʹcol the chief of his army, and they
returned to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines. 33 After that he planted a
tamarisk tree at Beʹer-sheʹba, and there he called on the name of Jehovah,
the everlasting God. 34 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Phi·lisʹtines
for a long time. |22| Now after this the true God put Abraham to the test, and
he said to him: “Abraham!“ to which he replied: “Here I am!“ 2 Then he
said: “Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac, and
travel to the land of Mo·riʹah and offer him up there as a burnt offering on
one of the mountains that I will designate to you.“ 3 So Abraham got up
early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his servants along
with him and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and then
he rose and traveled to the place that the true God indicated to him. 4 On the
third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place from a distance. 5 Abraham now
said to his servants: “You stay here with the donkey, but the boy and I will
go over there and worship and return to you.“ 6 So Abraham took the wood for
the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. Then he took in his hands the
fire and the knife, and the two of them walked on together. 7 Then Isaac said
to his father Abraham: “My father!“ He replied: “Yes, my son!“ So he
continued: “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the
burnt offering?“ 8 To this Abraham said: “God himself will provide the
sheep for the burnt offering, my son.“ And both of them walked on together. 
9 Finally they reached the place that the true God had indicated to him, and
Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son
Isaac hand and foot and put him on the altar on top of the wood. 10 Then
Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son. 11 But
Jehovah’s angel called to him from the heavens and said: “Abraham,
Abraham!“ to which he answered: “Here I am!“ 12 Then he said: “Do not
harm the boy, and do not do anything at all to him, for now I do know that you
are God-fearing because you have not withheld your son, your only one, from
me.“ 13 At that Abraham looked up, and there just beyond him was a ram
caught by its horns in a thicket. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered
it up as a burnt offering in place of his son. 14 And Abraham named that place
Je·hoʹvah-jiʹreh. This is why it is still said today: “In the mountain of
Jehovah it will be provided.“ 15 And Jehovah’s angel called to Abraham a
second time from the heavens, 16 saying: “‘By myself I swear,’ declares
Jehovah, ‘that because you have done this and you have not withheld your
son, your only one, 17 I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply your
offspring like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand on the
seashore, and your offspring will take possession of the gate of his enemies. 
18 And by means of your offspring all nations of the earth will obtain a

                                       19

Genesis 22

blessing for themselves because you have listened to my voice.’“ 19 After
that Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went back together
to Beʹer-sheʹba; and Abraham continued to dwell at Beʹer-sheʹba. 20 After
this it was reported to Abraham: “Here Milʹcah has also borne sons to
Naʹhor your brother: 21 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kem·uʹel the
father of Aʹram, 22 Cheʹsed, Haʹzo, Pilʹdash, Jidʹlaph, and
Be·thuʹel.“ 23 Be·thuʹel became the father of Re·bekʹah. Milʹcah bore
these eight to Naʹhor the brother of Abraham. 24 His concubine, whose name
was Reuʹmah, also bore sons: Teʹbah, Gaʹham, Taʹhash, and Maʹa·cah. |23|
And Sarah lived for 127 years; these were the years of Sarah’s life. 2 So
Sarah died in Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, in the land of Caʹnaan,
and Abraham began to mourn and to weep over Sarah. 3 Then Abraham got up from
before his dead wife and he said to the sons of Heth: 4 “I am a foreigner
and settler among you. Give me a property to serve as a burial place in your
midst so that I may remove my dead for burial.“ 5 At this the sons of Heth
answered Abraham: 6 “Hear us, my lord. You are a chieftain of God among us.
You may bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will
hold back his burial place from you to prevent you from burying your dead.“ 
7 So Abraham got up and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of
Heth, 8 and said to them: “If you agree to let me remove my dead for burial,
then listen to me and urge Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar 9 to sell me the cave
of Mach·peʹlah, which belongs to him; it is at the edge of his field. Let
him sell it to me in your presence for the full amount of silver so that I may
have a property for a burial place.“ 10 Now Eʹphron was sitting among the
sons of Heth. So Eʹphron the Hitʹtite answered Abraham in the hearing of the
sons of Heth, and before all who entered the gate of his city, saying: 11
“No, my lord! Listen to me. I give you both the field and the cave that is
in it. In the presence of the sons of my people, I give it to you. Bury your
dead.“ 12 At that Abraham bowed down before the people of the land 13 and
spoke to Eʹphron in the hearing of the people, saying: “Listen to me, if
you will! I will give you the full amount of silver for the field. Take it
from me, in order that I may bury my dead there.“ 14 Then Eʹphron answered
Abraham: 15 “My lord, listen to me. This land is worth 400 silver shekels,
but what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.“ 16 Abraham listened
to Eʹphron, and Abraham weighed out to Eʹphron the amount of silver that he
had mentioned in the hearing of the sons of Heth, 400 silver shekels according
to the weight accepted by the merchants. 17 Thus the field of Eʹphron in
Mach·peʹlah, which was in front of Mamʹre—the field and the cave in it
and all the trees within the boundaries of the field—became confirmed as 18
Abraham’s purchased property in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all
those entering the gate of his city. 19 After that Abraham buried his wife
Sarah in the cave of the field of Mach·peʹlah in front of Mamʹre, that is,
Hebʹron, in the land of Caʹnaan. 20 Thus the field and the cave that was in
it were transferred by the sons of Heth to Abraham as property for a burial
place. |24| Abraham was now old, advanced in years, and Jehovah had blessed
Abraham in everything. 2 Abraham said to his servant, the oldest one of his
household, who was managing all he had: “Please put your hand under my
thigh, 3 and I will make you swear by Jehovah, the God of the heavens and the
God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters
of the Caʹnaan·ites, among whom I am dwelling. 4 You must go instead to my
country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.“ 5
However, the servant said to him: “What if the woman is not willing to come

                                       20

---

Genesis 24

with me to this land? Must I then return your son to the land from which you
came?“ 6 At this Abraham said to him: “See that you do not take my son
there. 7 Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house
and from the land of my relatives and who spoke with me and swore to me: ‘To
your offspring I am going to give this land,’ he will send his angel ahead
of you, and you will certainly take a wife for my son from there. 8 But if the
woman is unwilling to come with you, you will be free from this oath. But you
must not take my son there.“ 9 With that the servant put his hand under the
thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter. 10 So the
servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking along all sorts
of good things from his master. Then he went on his way to
Mes·o·po·taʹmi·a, to the city of Naʹhor. 11 He had the camels kneel down
at a well of water outside the city. It was about evening, the time when the
women would go out to draw water. 12 Then he said: “Jehovah the God of my
master Abraham, please grant me success this day, and show your loyal love to
my master Abraham. 13 Here I am standing at a spring of water, and the
daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. 14 May it
happen that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your water jar
so that I may take a drink,’ and who replies, ‘Take a drink, and I will
also water your camels,’ let this be the one you choose for your servant
Isaac; and by this let me know that you have shown your loyal love to my
master.“ 15 Even before he finished speaking, Re·bekʹah, who was the
daughter of Be·thuʹel the son of Milʹcah the wife of Naʹhor, Abraham’s
brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder. 16 Now the young woman
was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had had sexual relations with her. She
went down to the spring, filled her water jar, and then came back up. 17 At
once the servant ran to meet her and said: “Please give me a little sip of
water from your jar.“ 18 In turn she said: “Drink, my lord.“ With that
she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink. 19 When she
finished giving him a drink, she said: “I will also draw water for your
camels until they are done drinking.“ 20 So she quickly emptied her jar into
the drinking trough and ran again and again to the well to draw water, and she
kept drawing water for all his camels. 21 The whole time the man silently
stared at her in amazement, wondering whether Jehovah had made his trip
successful or not. 22 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out
for her a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets of gold
weighing ten shekels, 23 and he said: “Please tell me, whose daughter are
you? Is there any room at your father’s house for us to spend the night?“ 
24 At that she said to him: “I am the daughter of Be·thuʹel the son of
Milʹcah, whom she bore to Naʹhor.“ 25 And she added: “We have both straw
and much fodder and also a place to spend the night.“ 26 Then the man bowed
down and prostrated himself before Jehovah 27 and said: “May Jehovah be
praised, the God of my master Abraham, for he has not abandoned his loyal love
and his faithfulness toward my master. Jehovah has guided me to the house of
the brothers of my master.“ 28 And the young woman ran to tell her
mother’s household about these things. 29 Now Re·bekʹah had a brother
whose name was Laʹban. So Laʹban ran to the man who was outside at the
spring. 30 When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets on the hands of his
sister and heard the words of his sister Re·bekʹah, who was saying, “This
is the way the man spoke to me,“ he came to meet the man, who was still
there standing by the camels at the spring. 31 At once he said: “Come, you
who are blessed by Jehovah. Why do you keep standing out here? I have made the

                                       21

Genesis 24

house ready and a place for the camels.“ 32 With that the man came into the
house, and he unharnessed the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels
and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 33
However, when something to eat was set before him, he said: “I will not eat
until I have told you what I have to say.“ So Laʹban said: “Speak!“ 34
Then he said: “I am Abraham’s servant. 35 And Jehovah has blessed my
master very much, and he has made him very wealthy by giving him sheep and
cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. 36
Further, Sarah the wife of my master bore a son to my master after she grew
old, and he will give him everything he has. 37 So my master made me swear,
saying: ‘You must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the
Caʹnaan·ites, in whose land I am dwelling. 38 No, but you will go to the
house of my father and to my family, and you must take a wife for my son.’ 
39 But I said to my master: ‘What if the woman is unwilling to come with
me?’ 40 He said to me: ‘Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his
angel with you and will certainly give success to your journey, and you must
take a wife for my son from my family and from the house of my father. 41 You
will be released from your oath to me if you go to my family and they will not
give her to you. This will release you from your oath.’ 42 “When I got to
the spring today, I said: ‘Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, if you will
make my journey successful, 43 here I am standing at a spring. What must take
place is that when a young woman comes out to draw water, I will say,
“Please, let me drink a little water from your jar,“ 44 and she will say
to me, “You take a drink, and I will also draw water for your camels.“ Let
that woman be the one whom Jehovah has chosen for the son of my master.’ 45
“Before I was finished speaking in my heart, there was Re·bekʹah coming
out with her jar on her shoulder, and she made her way down to the spring and
began to draw water. Then I said to her: ‘Give me a drink, please.’ 46 So
she quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said: ‘Take a drink, and I
will also water your camels.’ Then I took a drink, and she also watered the
camels. 47 After that I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ to which she
replied, ‘The daughter of Be·thuʹel the son of Naʹhor, whom Milʹcah bore
to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands. 48
And I bowed down and prostrated myself before Jehovah and praised Jehovah the
God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to take the
daughter of the brother of my master for his son. 49 And now tell me if you
wish to show loyal love and faithfulness toward my master; but if not, tell
me, so that I may proceed one way or the other.“ 50 Then Laʹban and
Be·thuʹel answered: “This is from Jehovah. We are not able to say yes or
no to you. 51 Here is Re·bekʹah before you. Take her and go, and let her
become a wife to the son of your master, just as Jehovah has spoken.“ 52
When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he at once bowed down on the
ground before Jehovah. 53 And the servant began to bring out articles of
silver and of gold and garments and to give them to Re·bekʹah, and he gave
valuable things to her brother and to her mother. 54 After that he and the men
with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there.
When he got up in the
morning, he said: “Send me off to my master.“ 55 To this her brother and
her mother said: “Let the young woman stay with us at least ten days. Then
she can go.“ 56 But he said to them: “Do not detain me, seeing that
Jehovah has made my journey successful. Send me off, in order that I may go to
my master.“ 57 So they said: “Let us call the young woman and inquire of
her.“ 58 They called Re·bekʹah and said to her: “Will you go with this

                                       22

Genesis 24

man?“ She replied: “I am willing to go.“ 59 So they sent off their
sister Re·bekʹah and her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men. 60 And
they blessed Re·bekʹah and said to her: “Our sister, may you become
thousands times ten thousand, and let your offspring take possession of the
gate of those who hate them.“ 61 Then Re·bekʹah and her female attendants
rose, got on the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Re·bekʹah
and went on his way. 62 Now Isaac had come from the direction of
Beʹer-laʹhai-roi, for he was dwelling in the land of the Negʹeb. 63 And
Isaac was out walking in the field about nightfall to meditate. When he looked
up, why, he saw that camels were coming! 64 When Re·bekʹah looked up, she
caught sight of Isaac, and she quickly got down from the camel. 65 Then she
asked the servant: “Who is that man there walking in the field to meet
us?“ And the servant said: “It is my master.“ So she took her veil to
cover herself. 66 And the servant told Isaac all the things he had done. 67
After that Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother. Thus he took
Re·bekʹah as his wife; and he fell in love with her, and Isaac found comfort
after the loss of his mother. |25| Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name
was Ke·tuʹrah. 2 In time she bore him Zimʹran, Jokʹshan, Meʹdan,
Midʹi·an, Ishʹbak, and Shuʹah. 3 Jokʹshan became father to Sheʹba and
Deʹdan.
The sons of Deʹdan were As·shuʹrim, Le·tuʹshim, and Le·umʹmim.
4 The sons of Midʹi·an were Eʹphah, Eʹpher, Haʹnoch, A·biʹda, and
El·daʹah.
All of these were the sons of Ke·tuʹrah. 5 Later on Abraham gave
everything he had to Isaac, 6 but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his
concubines. Then while he was still alive, he sent them eastward, away from
Isaac his son, to the land of the East. 7 The years of Abraham’s life were
175 years. 8 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old
and satisfied, and was gathered to his people. 9 His sons Isaac and
Ishʹma·el buried him in the cave of Mach·peʹlah in the field of Eʹphron
the son of Zoʹhar the Hitʹtite that is in front of Mamʹre, 10 the field
that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried,
with his wife Sarah. 11 After Abraham’s death, God continued to bless his
son Isaac, and Isaac was dwelling near Beʹer-laʹhai-roi. 12 This is the
history of Ishʹma·el the son of Abraham whom Haʹgar the Egyptian, the
servant of Sarah, bore to Abraham. 13 Now these are the names of the sons of
Ishʹma·el, by their names according to their family origins: Ishʹma·el’s
firstborn Ne·baʹioth, then Keʹdar, Adʹbe·el, Mibʹsam, 14 Mishʹma,
Duʹmah, Masʹsa, 15 Haʹdad, Teʹma, Jeʹtur, Naʹphish, and Kedʹe·mah. 16
These are the sons of Ishʹma·el, and these are their names by their
settlements and by their encampments, 12 chieftains according to their clans. 
17 And Ishʹma·el lived for 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died and
was gathered to his people. 18 And they took up dwelling from Havʹi·lah near
Shur, which is close to Egypt, as far as As·syrʹi·a. He settled near all
his brothers. 19 And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham.
Abraham
became father to Isaac. 20 Isaac was 40 years old when he married Re·bekʹah,
the daughter of Be·thuʹel the A·ra·maeʹan of Padʹdan-aʹram, the sister
of Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan. 21 And Isaac kept pleading with Jehovah
regarding his wife, because she was barren; so Jehovah responded to his plea,
and his wife Re·bekʹah became pregnant. 22 And the sons within her began to
struggle with each other, so that she said: “If this is the way it is, why
should I go on living?“ So she inquired of Jehovah. 23 And Jehovah said to
her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from
within you; and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation, and the

                                       23

Genesis 25

older will serve the younger.“ 24 When the time came for her to give birth,
look! twins were in her womb. 25 Then the first came out red all over and was
like a garment of hair, so they named him Eʹsau. 26 After that his brother
came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Eʹsau, so he named him
Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them. 27 As the boys got
bigger, Eʹsau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a
blameless man, dwelling in tents. 28 And Isaac loved Eʹsau because it meant
game in his mouth, whereas Re·bekʹah loved Jacob. 29 On one occasion Jacob
was boiling some stew when Eʹsau returned from the field exhausted. 30 So
Eʹsau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me some of the red stew that you
have there, for I am exhausted!“ That is why his name was Eʹdom. 31 To this
Jacob said: “First sell me your right as firstborn!“ 32 And Eʹsau
continued: “Here I am about to die! What use is a birthright to me?“ 33
And Jacob added: “Swear to me first!“ So he swore to him and sold his
right as firstborn to Jacob. 34 Then Jacob gave Eʹsau bread and lentil stew,
and he ate and drank, and he got up and went away. Thus Eʹsau despised the
birthright. |26| Now there was a famine in the land, in addition to the first
famine that occurred in the days of Abraham, so that Isaac went to
A·bimʹe·lech king of the Phi·lisʹtines, in Geʹrar. 2 Then Jehovah
appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt. Dwell in the land that I
designate to you. 3 Reside as a foreigner in this land, and I will continue
with you and bless you because to you and to your offspring I will give all
these lands, and I will carry out the oath that I swore to your father
Abraham: 4 ‘I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens;
and I will give to your offspring all these lands; and by means of your
offspring, all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves,’ 
5 on account of the fact that Abraham listened to my voice and continued to
keep my requirements, my commands, my statutes, and my laws.“ 6 So Isaac
continued to dwell in Geʹrar. 7 When the men of the place kept asking about
his wife, he would say: “She is my sister.“ He was afraid to say, “She
is my wife,“ for he said, “The men of the place might kill me because of
Re·bekʹah,“ for she was beautiful in appearance. 8 After some time had
passed, A·bimʹe·lech king of the Phi·lisʹtines was looking out of the
window, and he saw Isaac displaying affection for Re·bekʹah his wife. 9 At
once A·bimʹe·lech called Isaac and said: “She is actually your wife! Why
did you say, ‘She is my sister’?“ At this Isaac said to him: “I said
it for fear I should die because of her.“ 10 But A·bimʹe·lech continued:
“What have you done to us? One of the people could easily have lain down
with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us!“ 11 Then
A·bimʹe·lech commanded all the people, saying: “Anybody touching this man
and his wife will surely be put to death!“ 12 And Isaac began to sow seed in
that land, and in that year he reaped 100 times what he sowed, for Jehovah was
blessing him. 13 The man became wealthy, and he continued to prosper until he
became very wealthy. 14 He acquired flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a
large body of servants, and the Phi·lisʹtines began to envy him. 15 So the
Phi·lisʹtines took soil and stopped up all the wells that his father’s
servants had dug in the days of Abraham. 16 A·bimʹe·lech then said to
Isaac: “Move from our neighborhood, for you have grown far stronger than we
are.“ 17 So Isaac moved from there and encamped in the valley of Geʹrar and
began dwelling there. 18 And Isaac again dug the wells that had been dug in
the days of his father Abraham but that the Phi·lisʹtines had stopped up
after Abraham’s death, and he called them by the names that his father had

                                       24

Genesis 26

given them. 19 When the servants of Isaac were digging in the valley, they
found a well of fresh water. 20 And the shepherds of Geʹrar began quarreling
with the shepherds of Isaac, saying: “The water is ours!“ So he named the
well Eʹsek, because they had quarreled with him. 21 And they started digging
another well, and they began quarreling over it also. So he named it Sitʹnah.
22 Later he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not
quarrel over it. So he named it Re·hoʹboth and said: “It is because now
Jehovah has given us ample room and has made us fruitful in the land.“ 23
Then he went up from there to Beʹer-sheʹba. 24 That night Jehovah appeared
to him and said: “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for
I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your offspring on account of
Abraham my servant.“ 25 So he built an altar there and called on the name of
Jehovah. And Isaac pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well there. 
26 Later A·bimʹe·lech came to him from Geʹrar with A·huzʹzath his
personal adviser and Phiʹcol the chief of his army. 27 At this Isaac said to
them: “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hated me and sent me away
from your neighborhood?“ 28 To this they said: “We have clearly seen that
Jehovah has been with you. So we said, ‘Let there, please, be an oath of
obligation between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you 29 that you
will do nothing bad to us just as we have not harmed you, seeing that we have
done only good to you in that we sent you away in peace. You now are the
blessed of Jehovah.’“ 30 Then he made a feast for them, and they ate and
drank. 31 In the morning they got up early and swore an oath to each other.
After that Isaac sent them away, and they went from him in peace. 32 On that
day the servants of Isaac came and reported to him about the well that they
had dug, and they told him: “We have found water!“ 33 So he named it
Shiʹbah. That is why the name of the city is Beʹer-sheʹba to this day. 34
When Eʹsau was 40 years old, he took as wife Juʹdith the daughter of
Be·eʹri the Hitʹtite and also Basʹe·math the daughter of Eʹlon the
Hitʹtite. 35 They were a source of great grief to Isaac and Re·bekʹah. |27|
Now when Isaac was old and his eyes were too weak to see, he called Eʹsau his
older son to him and said: “My son!“ He replied: “Here I am!“ 2 And he
went on to say: “I have now grown old. I do not know the day of my death. 3
So at this time take, please, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go
out to the field and hunt some wild game for me. 4 Then make the kind of tasty
dish that I am fond of and bring it to me. Then I will eat it so that I may
bless you before I die.“ 5 However, Re·bekʹah was listening while Isaac
spoke to Eʹsau his son. And Eʹsau went out into the field to hunt game and
to bring it in. 6 And Re·bekʹah said to Jacob her son: “I just heard your
father speaking to your brother Eʹsau, saying, 7 ‘Bring me some game and
make me a tasty dish. Then let me eat so that I may bless you before Jehovah
before my death.’ 8 And now, my son, listen carefully and do what I am
instructing you. 9 Go, please, to the herd and get me two of the best young
goats from there so that I may prepare from them a tasty dish for your father,
just the way he likes it. 10 Then take it to your father to eat, in order that
he may bless you before his death.“ 11 Jacob said to his mother Re·bekʹah:
“But Eʹsau my brother is a hairy man, and my skin is smooth. 12 What if my
father feels me? Then I will certainly appear to be mocking him, and I will
bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.“ 13 At this his mother
said to him: “Upon me be the curse meant for you, my son. Just do as I say
and go, get them for me.“ 14 So he went and got them and brought them to his
mother, and his mother made a tasty dish, just the way his father liked it. 15

                                       25

Genesis 27

After that Re·bekʹah took her older son Eʹsau’s finest garments, which
she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 16 She also put
the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the hairless part of his
neck. 17 Then she handed the tasty dish and the bread that she had made to her
son Jacob. 18 So he went in to his father and said: “My father!“ to which
he said: “Here I am! Who are you, my son?“ 19 Jacob said to his father:
“I am Eʹsau your firstborn. I have done just as you told me. Sit up,
please, and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.“ 20 At that Isaac
said to his son: “How were you so quick in finding it, my son?“ He
replied: “Because Jehovah your God brought it to me.“ 21 Then Isaac said
to Jacob: “Come near, please, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether
you are really my son Eʹsau or not.“ 22 So Jacob came near to his father
Isaac, and he felt him, after which he said: “The voice is the voice of
Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Eʹsau.“ 23 He did not recognize him
because his hands were hairy like the hands of his brother Eʹsau. So he
blessed him. 24 After that he asked: “Are you really my son Eʹsau?“ to
which he replied: “I am.“ 25 Then he said: “Bring me some of the wild
game for me to eat, my son, then I will bless you.“ With that he brought it
to him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank. 26 Then Isaac his
father said to him: “Come near, please, and kiss me, my son.“ 27 So he
came near and kissed him, and he could smell the scent of his garments. Then
he blessed him and said:
“See, the scent of my son is like the scent of the
field that Jehovah has blessed. 28 May the true God give you the dews of the
heavens and the fertile soils of the earth and an abundance of grain and new
wine. 29 Let peoples serve you, and let nations bow low to you. Be master over
your brothers, and let the sons of your mother bow low to you. Cursed be
everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you.“ 30 Now
Isaac had just finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had barely left the presence
of his father Isaac when his brother Eʹsau came back from his hunting. 31 He
too prepared a tasty dish and brought it to his father, and he said to his
father: “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, in order
that you may bless me.“ 32 At this his father Isaac said to him: “Who are
you?“ to which he said: “I am your son, your firstborn, Eʹsau.“ 33 And
Isaac began to tremble violently, so he said: “Who was it, then, who hunted
for game and brought it to me? I already ate it before you arrived, and I
blessed him—and he will surely be blessed!“ 34 On hearing his father’s
words, Eʹsau began to cry out in an extremely loud and bitter manner and to
say to his father: “Bless me, yes, me too, my father!“ 35 But he said:
“Your brother came deceitfully so that he might get the blessing meant for
you.“ 36 At this he said: “Is he not rightly named Jacob, that he might
supplant me these two times? My birthright he has already taken, and now he
has taken my blessing!“ Then he added: “Have you not reserved a blessing
for me?“ 37 But Isaac answered Eʹsau: “Here I have appointed him master
over you, and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and I have
bestowed grain and new wine for his support. What is left that I can do for
you, my son?“ 38 Eʹsau said to his father: “Is there just one blessing
that you have, my father? Bless me, yes, me too, my father!“ With that
Eʹsau cried loudly and burst into tears. 39 So his father Isaac answered
him:
“See, away from the fertile soils of the earth your dwelling will be,
and away from the dew of the heavens above. 40 And by your sword you will
live, and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will
indeed break his yoke off your neck.“ 41 However, Eʹsau harbored animosity

                                       26

Genesis 27

against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him, and Eʹsau
kept saying in his heart: “The days of mourning for my father are getting
closer. After that I am going to kill Jacob my brother.“ 42 When the words
of her older son Eʹsau were told to Re·bekʹah, she at once sent for her
younger son Jacob and said to him: “Look! Your brother Eʹsau is planning to
take revenge by killing you. 43 Now, my son, do as I say. Get up and run away
to my brother Laʹban at Haʹran. 44 Dwell with him for a while until your
brother’s rage calms down, 45 until your brother’s anger toward you
subsides and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you
from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?“ 46 After that
Re·bekʹah kept saying to Isaac: “I am disgusted with my life because of
the daughters of Heth. If Jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of Heth,
like these daughters of the land, what good is my life?“ |28| So Isaac
called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him, saying: “You must not take a
wife from the daughters of Caʹnaan. 2 Go away to Padʹdan-aʹram to the house
of Be·thuʹel, your mother’s father, and from there take for yourself a
wife from the daughters of Laʹban, your mother’s brother. 3 God Almighty
will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and you will certainly
become a congregation of peoples. 4 And he will give to you the blessing of
Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you may take
possession of the land where you have been living as a foreigner, which God
has given to Abraham.“ 5 So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he departed for
Padʹdan-aʹram, to Laʹban the son of Be·thuʹel the A·ra·maeʹan, the
brother of Re·bekʹah, the mother of Jacob and Eʹsau. 6 Eʹsau saw that
Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Padʹdan-aʹram to take a
wife from there and that when he blessed him, he commanded him, “Do not take
a wife from the daughters of Caʹnaan,“ 7 and that Jacob obeyed his father
and his mother and departed for Padʹdan-aʹram. 8 Eʹsau then realized that
the daughters of Caʹnaan were displeasing to his father Isaac, 9 so Eʹsau
went to Ishʹma·el and took as wife Maʹha·lath the daughter of Abraham’s
son Ishʹma·el, the sister of Ne·baʹioth, in addition to the other wives he
already had. 10 Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba and kept going toward
Haʹran. 11 In time he came to a place and prepared to spend the night there
because the sun had set. So he took one of the stones of that place and set it
to rest his head on and lay down there. 12 Then he had a dream, and look!
there was a stairway set on the earth, and its top reached up to the heavens;
and there were God’s angels ascending and descending on it. 13 And look!
there was Jehovah stationed above it, and he said:
“I am Jehovah the God of
Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you are lying, to
you I am going to give it and to your offspring. 14 And your offspring will
certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, and you will spread
abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and by
means of you and by means of your offspring all the families of the ground
will certainly be blessed. 15 I am with you, and I will safeguard you wherever
you go, and I will return you to this land. I will not leave you until I have
done what I have promised you.“ 16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said:
“Truly Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.“ 17 And he grew
fearful and added: “How awe-inspiring this place is! This can only be the
house of God, and this is the gate of the heavens.“ 18 So Jacob got up early
in the morning and took the stone on which he had rested his head and set it
up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. 19 So he named that place
Bethʹel, but previously the city’s name was Luz. 20 Jacob then made a vow,

                                       27

Genesis 28

saying: “If God will continue with me and will protect me on my journey and
will give me bread to eat and garments to wear 21 and I return in peace to the
house of my father, then Jehovah will certainly have proved to be my God. 22
And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will become a house of God, and
without fail I will give you a tenth of everything you give to me.“ |29|
After that Jacob resumed his journey and traveled on to the land of the people
of the East. 2 Now he saw a well in the field and three droves of sheep lying
down next to it, because they usually watered the droves from that well. There
was a large stone over the mouth of the well. 3 When all the droves had been
gathered there, they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and
they watered the flocks, after which they returned the stone to its place over
the mouth of the well. 4 So Jacob said to them: “My brothers, what place are
you from?“ to which they said: “We are from Haʹran.“ 5 He said to them:
“Do you know Laʹban the grandson of Naʹhor?“ to which they said: “We
know him.“ 6 At this he said to them: “Is he well?“ They replied: “He
is well. And here is his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep!“ 7 Then he
said: “It is still the middle of the day. It is not the time for gathering
the herds. Water the sheep, and then go feed them.“ 8 To this they said:
“We are not allowed to do so until all the droves are gathered and they roll
the stone away from the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.“ 9 While
he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she
was a shepherdess. 10 When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laʹban his
mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laʹban, Jacob immediately approached and
rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of
Laʹban his mother’s brother. 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and raised his
voice and burst into tears. 12 And Jacob began to tell Rachel that he was the
relative of her father and that he was the son of Re·bekʹah. And she ran off
and told her father. 13 As soon as Laʹban heard the report about Jacob the
son of his sister, he ran to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and
brought him into his house. And he began to tell Laʹban all these things. 14
Laʹban said to him: “You are indeed my bone and my flesh.“ So he stayed
with him a full month. 15 Laʹban then said to Jacob: “Just because you are
my relative, should you serve me for nothing? Tell me, what are your wages to
be?“ 16 Now Laʹban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leʹah, and
the name of the younger, Rachel. 17 But the eyes of Leʹah had no luster,
whereas Rachel had become a very attractive and beautiful woman. 18 Jacob had
fallen in love with Rachel, so he said: “I am willing to serve you seven
years for your younger daughter Rachel.“ 19 To this Laʹban said: “It is
better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man. Keep
dwelling with me.“ 20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but in his
eyes they were like just a few days because of his love for her. 21 Then Jacob
said to Laʹban: “Give over my wife because my days are up, and let me have
relations with her.“ 22 With that Laʹban gathered all the men of the place
and made a feast. 23 But during the evening, he resorted to taking his
daughter Leʹah and bringing her to him that he might have relations with her.
24 Laʹban also gave his female servant Zilʹpah to his daughter Leʹah as a
servant. 25 In the morning Jacob saw that it was Leʹah! So he said to
Laʹban: “What have you done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you?
Why have you tricked me?“ 26 To this Laʹban said: “It is not our custom
here to give the younger woman before the firstborn. 27 Celebrate the week of
this woman. After that you will also be given this other woman in exchange for
serving me seven more years.“ 28 Jacob did so and celebrated the week of

                                       28

Genesis 29

this woman, after which he gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife. 29 Besides,
Laʹban gave his female servant Bilʹhah to his daughter Rachel as her
servant. 30 Then Jacob had relations also with Rachel, and he loved Rachel
more than Leʹah, and he served him for another seven years. 31 When Jehovah
saw that Leʹah was unloved, he then enabled her to become pregnant, but
Rachel was barren. 32 So Leʹah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and
named him Reuʹben, for she said: “It is because Jehovah has looked upon my
affliction, for now my husband will begin to love me.“ 33 And she again
became pregnant and gave birth to a son and then said: “It is because
Jehovah has listened, in that I was unloved, so he gave me this one also.“
Then she named him Simʹe·on. 34 And she became pregnant yet again and gave
birth to a son and then said: “Now this time my husband will join himself to
me, because I have borne him three sons.“ Therefore, he was named Leʹvi. 35
And she became pregnant once more and gave birth to a son and then said:
“This time I will praise Jehovah.“ She therefore named him Judah. After
that she stopped giving birth. |30| When Rachel saw that she had borne no
children to Jacob, she became jealous of her sister and began to say to Jacob:
“Give me children or else I will die.“ 2 At this Jacob’s anger flared up
against Rachel, and he said: “Am I in the place of God, who has prevented
you from having children?“ 3 So she said: “Here is my slave girl Bilʹhah.
Have relations with her in order that she may bear children for me and that
through her, I too may have children.“ 4 With that she gave him her servant
Bilʹhah as a wife, and Jacob had relations with her. 5 Bilʹhah became
pregnant and in time bore Jacob a son. 6 Then Rachel said: “God has acted as
my judge and has also listened to my voice, so that he gave me a son.“ That
is why she named him Dan. 7 Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, became pregnant once
more and in time bore Jacob a second son. 8 Then Rachel said: “With
strenuous wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister. I have also come off the
winner!“ So she named him Naphʹta·li. 9 When Leʹah saw that she had
stopped having children, she took her servant Zilʹpah and gave her to Jacob
as a wife. 10 And Leʹah’s servant Zilʹpah bore a son to Jacob. 11 Then
Leʹah said: “With good fortune!“ So she named him Gad. 12 After that
Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, bore a second son to Jacob. 13 Then Leʹah said:
“With my happiness! For the daughters will certainly pronounce me happy.“
So she named him Ashʹer. 14 Now Reuʹben was walking in the days of the wheat
harvest, and he found mandrakes in the field. So he brought them to his mother
Leʹah. Then Rachel said to Leʹah: “Give me, please, some of your son’s
mandrakes.“ 15 At this she said to her: “Is it a small matter that you
took my husband? Would you now take my son’s mandrakes also?“ So Rachel
said: “Very well. He will lie down with you tonight in exchange for your
son’s mandrakes.“ 16 When Jacob was coming from the field in the evening,
Leʹah went out to meet him and said: “It is with me you are going to have
relations, because I have hired you outright with my son’s mandrakes.“ So
he lay down with her that night. 17 And God heard and answered Leʹah, and she
became pregnant and in time bore to Jacob a fifth son. 18 Then Leʹah said:
“God has given me my wages because I have given my servant to my husband.“
So she named him Isʹsa·char. 19 And Leʹah became pregnant once more and in
time bore a sixth son to Jacob. 20 Then Leʹah said: “God has endowed me,
yes, me, with a good endowment. At last, my husband will tolerate me, for I
have borne him six sons.“ So she named him Zebʹu·lun. 21 Afterward she
bore a daughter and named her Diʹnah. 22 Finally God remembered Rachel, and
God heard and answered her by enabling her to become pregnant. 23 And she

                                       29

Genesis 30

became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then she said: “God has taken away
my reproach!“ 24 So she named him Joseph, saying: “Jehovah is adding
another son to me.“ 25 After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob
immediately said to Laʹban: “Send me away so that I may go to my place and
to my land. 26 Give over my wives and my children, for whom I have served with
you, that I may go, for you well know how I have served you.“ 27 Then
Laʹban said to him: “If I have found favor in your eyes,—I have
understood by the omens that Jehovah is blessing me because of you.“ 28 And
he added: “Stipulate your wages to me, and I will give them.“ 29 So Jacob
said to him: “You know how I have served you and how your herd has fared
with me; 30 you had little before my coming, but your herd has increased and
multiplied, and Jehovah has blessed you since I arrived. So when will I do
something for my own house?“ 31 Then he said: “What should I give you?“
And Jacob said: “You will give me nothing whatsoever! If you will do this
one thing for me, I will resume shepherding your flock and guarding it. 32 I
will pass through your whole flock today. You set aside from there every sheep
speckled and with color patches and every dark-brown sheep among the young
rams and any color-patched and speckled one among the she-goats. From now on,
these must become my wages. 33 And my righteousness must speak for me on a
future day when you come to look over my wages; every one that is not speckled
and color-patched among the she-goats and dark brown among the young rams will
be considered stolen if it is with me.“ 34 To this Laʹban said: “That is
fine! Let it be according to your word.“ 35 Then on that day, he set aside
the he-goats striped and color-patched and all the she-goats speckled and
color-patched, every one in which there was any white and every one dark brown
among the young rams, and gave them into the care of his sons. 36 After that
he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and
Jacob was shepherding the flocks of Laʹban that remained over. 37 Jacob then
took freshly cut staffs of the storax, almond, and plane trees, and he peeled
white spots in them by exposing the white wood of the staffs. 38 Then he
placed the staffs that he had peeled in front of the flock, in the gutters, in
the drinking troughs, where the flocks would come to drink, that they might
get into heat in front of them when they came to drink. 39 So the flocks would
get into heat in front of the staffs, and the flocks would produce striped,
speckled, and color-patched offspring. 40 Then Jacob separated the young rams
and turned the flocks to face the striped ones and all the dark-brown ones
among the flocks of Laʹban. Then he separated his own flocks and did not mix
them with Laʹban’s flocks. 41 And whenever the robust animals would get
into heat, Jacob would place the staffs in the gutters before the eyes of the
flocks, that they might get into heat by the staffs. 42 But when the animals
were weak, he would not place the staffs there. So the weak ones always came
to be Laʹban’s, but the robust ones became Jacob’s. 43 And the man grew
very prosperous, and he acquired great flocks and male and female servants and
camels and donkeys. |31| In time he heard what the sons of Laʹban were
saying: “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father, and from
what belonged to our father, he has amassed all this wealth.“ 2 When Jacob
would look at the face of Laʹban, he saw that his attitude toward him was not
what it used to be. 3 Finally Jehovah said to Jacob: “Return to the land of
your fathers and to your relatives, and I will continue with you.“ 4 Then
Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leʹah to come out to the field to his
flock, 5 and he said to them:
“I have seen that your father’s attitude
toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me. 6 You

                                       30

Genesis 31

yourselves certainly know that I have served your father with all my power. 7
And your father has tried to cheat me and has changed my wages ten times; but
God has not allowed him to do me harm. 8 If on the one hand he would say,
‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced
speckled ones; but if on the other hand he would say, ‘The striped ones will
be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped ones. 9 So God kept
taking your father’s livestock away from him and giving it to me. 10 Once
when the flock got into heat, I raised my eyes and saw in a dream that the
he-goats mating with the flock were striped, speckled, and spotty. 11 Then the
angel of the true God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ to which I said,
‘Here I am.’ 12 And he continued, ‘Raise your eyes, please, and see that
all the he-goats mating with the flock are striped, speckled, and spotty, for
I have seen all that Laʹban is doing to you. 13 I am the true God of
Bethʹel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now get
up, go out of this land, and return to the land of your birth.’“ 14 At
this Rachel and Leʹah answered him: “Is there any share left for us to
inherit in our father’s house? 15 Does he not consider us as foreigners,
since he has sold us and has been using up the money given for us? 16 All the
riches that God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s.
So, then, do everything that God has told you to do.“ 17 Then Jacob got up
and lifted his children and his wives on the camels, 18 and he began driving
all his herd and all the goods that he had accumulated, the livestock in his
possession that he had accumulated in Padʹdan-aʹram, to go to Isaac his
father in the land of Caʹnaan. 19 Now Laʹban had gone to shear his sheep,
and Rachel stole the teraphim statues that belonged to her father. 20
Moreover, Jacob outwitted Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan, for he had not told him
that he was running away. 21 And he ran away and crossed the River, he and all
he had. Then he headed toward the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. 22 On the
third day, Laʹban was told that Jacob had run away. 23 So he took his
brothers with him and pursued him for a journey of seven days and caught up
with him in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. 24 Then God came to Laʹban
the A·ra·maeʹan in a dream by night and said to him: “Be careful about
what you say to Jacob, either good or bad.“ 25 So Laʹban approached Jacob,
as Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and Laʹban had encamped with
his brothers in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. 26 Then Laʹban said to
Jacob: “What have you done? Why have you resorted to outwitting me and
carrying my daughters off like captives taken by the sword? 27 Why did you run
away secretly and outwit me and not tell me? If you had told me, I could have
sent you away with rejoicing and with songs, with tambourine and with harp. 28
But you did not give me a chance to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters.
You have acted foolishly. 29 It is in my power to do harm to you, but the God
of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful about what you
say to Jacob, either good or bad.’ 30 Now you have gone because you have
been longing to return to the house of your father, but why have you stolen my
gods?“ 31 Jacob answered Laʹban: “It was because I was afraid, for I said
to myself, ‘You might take your daughters away from me by force.’ 32
Anyone with whom you find your gods will not live. Before our brothers,
examine what I have, and take what is yours.“ But Jacob did not know that
Rachel had stolen them. 33 So Laʹban went into the tent of Jacob and into the
tent of Leʹah and into the tent of the two slave girls, but did not find
them. Then he came out of Leʹah’s tent and went into Rachel’s tent. 34
Meanwhile, Rachel had taken the teraphim statues and put them in the woman’s

                                       31

Genesis 31

saddle basket of the camel, and she was sitting on them. So Laʹban searched
through the whole tent but did not find them. 35 Then she said to her father:
“Do not be angry, my lord, because I am not able to get up before you, for
the customary thing with women is upon me.“ So he searched on carefully but
did not find the teraphim statues. 36 At that Jacob became angry and began to
criticize Laʹban. Jacob then said to Laʹban: “What is my offense, and for
what sin are you hotly pursuing me? 37 Now that you have searched through all
my goods, what have you found that belongs to your house? Put it here in front
of my brothers and your brothers, and let them decide between the two of us. 
38 During these 20 years that I have been with you, your sheep and your goats
never miscarried, and I never ate the rams of your flock. 39 I did not bring
you any animal torn by wild beasts. I would stand the loss of it myself.
Whether the animal was stolen by day or was stolen by night, you would demand
compensation from me. 40 By day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night,
and sleep would flee from my eyes. 41 This makes 20 years for me in your
house. I have served you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your
flock, and you kept changing my wages ten times. 42 If the God of my father,
the God of Abraham and the One whom Isaac fears, had not been on my side, you
would now have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the
toil of my hands, and that is why he reproved you last night.“ 43 Then
Laʹban answered Jacob: “The daughters are my daughters and the children my
children and the flock my flock, and everything you are looking at is mine and
my daughters’. What can I do today against these or against their children
whom they have borne? 44 Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and it
will serve as a witness between us.“ 45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up
as a pillar. 46 Then Jacob said to his brothers: “Pick up stones!“ And
they took stones and made a pile. After that they ate there on the pile of
stones. 47 And Laʹban began calling it Jeʹgar-sa·ha·duʹtha, but Jacob
called it Galʹe·ed. 48 Laʹban then said: “This pile of stones is a
witness between me and you today.“ That is why he named it Galʹe·ed, 49
and the Watchtower, for he said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me
when we are out of each other’s sight. 50 If you mistreat my daughters and
if you start taking wives in addition to my daughters, though there is no man
with us, remember that God will be a witness between you and me.“ 51 Laʹban
went on to say to Jacob: “Here is this pile of stones, and here is the
pillar that I have erected between you and me. 52 This pile of stones is a
witness, and the pillar is something that bears witness, that I will not pass
beyond this pile of stones to bring harm to you and you will not pass beyond
this pile of stones and this pillar to bring harm to me. 53 Let the God of
Abraham and the God of Naʹhor, the God of their father, judge between us.“
And Jacob swore by the One whom his father Isaac fears. 54 After that Jacob
offered a sacrifice in the mountain and invited his brothers to eat bread. So
they ate and spent the night in the mountain. 55 However, Laʹban got up early
in the morning and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed
them. Then Laʹban departed and returned home. |32| Jacob then went on his
way, and the angels of God met up with him. 2 As soon as he saw them, Jacob
said: “This is the camp of God!“ So he named that place Ma·ha·naʹim. 3
Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Eʹsau in the land of
Seʹir, the territory of Eʹdom, 4 and he commanded them: “This is what you
will say to my lord, to Eʹsau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob says: “I
have resided with Laʹban for a long time until now. 5 And I have acquired
bulls, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants, and I send this message

                                       32

Genesis 32

to inform my lord, in order to find favor in your eyes.“’“ 6 In time the
messengers returned to Jacob, saying: “We met your brother Eʹsau, and he is
now on his way to meet you, and there are 400 men with him.“ 7 And Jacob
became very frightened and anxious. So he divided the people who were with
him, as well as the flocks, the cattle, and the camels, into two camps. 8 He
said: “If Eʹsau attacks the one camp, then the other camp will be able to
escape.“ 9 After that Jacob said: “O God of my father Abraham and God of
my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you who are saying to me, ‘Return to your land
and to your relatives, and I will deal well with you,’ 10 I am unworthy of
all the loyal love and of all the faithfulness that you have shown toward your
servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become
two camps. 11 Save me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother Eʹsau, for I
am afraid of him that he may come and attack me, as well as the mothers and
their children. 12 And you have said: ‘I will certainly deal well with you,
and I will make your offspring like the grains of sand of the sea, which are
too numerous to count.’“ 13 And he spent the night there. Then he took
some of his possessions as a gift for Eʹsau his brother: 14 200 female goats,
20 male goats, 200 female sheep, 20 rams, 15 30 camels nursing their young, 40
cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 full-grown male donkeys. 16 He handed
them over to his servants, one drove after another, and he said to his
servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and you are to set a space between one
drove and the next.“ 17 He also commanded the first one: “In case Eʹsau
my brother should meet you and ask, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are
you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’ 18 then you should
say, ‘To your servant Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord, to Eʹsau, and
look! he himself is also behind us.’“ 19 And he commanded also the second,
the third, and all those following the droves: “According to this word, you
are to speak to Eʹsau when you meet him. 20 And you should also say, ‘Here
is your servant Jacob behind us.’“ For he said to himself: ‘If I appease
him by sending a gift ahead of me, then afterward when I see him, he may give
me a kindly reception.’ 21 So the gift crossed over ahead of him, but he
himself spent the night in the camp. 22 Later during that night, he rose and
took his two wives and his two female servants and his 11 young sons and
crossed over the ford of Jabʹbok. 23 So he took them and brought them across
the stream, and he brought over everything else he had. 24 Finally Jacob was
left by himself. Then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke. 25
When he saw that he had not prevailed over him, he touched the socket of his
hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated during his wrestling with
him. 26 After that he said: “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.“ To this
he said: “I am not going to let you go until you bless me.“ 27 So he said
to him: “What is your name?“ to which he said: “Jacob.“ 28 Then he
said: “Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel, for you have contended
with God and with men and you have at last prevailed.“ 29 In turn Jacob
inquired: “Tell me, please, your name.“ However, he said: “Why is it
that you ask my name?“ With that he blessed him there. 30 So Jacob named the
place Pe·niʹel, for he said, “I have seen God face-to-face, yet my life
was preserved.“ 31 And the sun rose upon him as soon as he passed by
Pe·nuʹel, but he was limping because of his hip. 32 That is why to this day
the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the thigh sinew, which is on the
socket of the hip joint, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip joint
by the thigh sinew. |33| Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Eʹsau coming, and
400 men were with him. So he divided the children among Leʹah, Rachel, and

                                       33

Genesis 33

the two female servants. 2 He put the female servants and their children in
front, Leʹah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them. 
3 Then he himself went ahead of them and bowed down to the earth seven times
as he came near to his brother. 4 But Eʹsau ran to meet him, and he embraced
him and kissed him, and they burst into tears. 5 When he raised his eyes and
saw the women and the children, he said: “Who are these with you?“ to
which he said: “The children with whom God has favored your servant.“ 6 At
that the female servants came forward with their children and bowed down, 7
and Leʹah too came forward with her children, and they bowed down. Then
Joseph came forward with Rachel, and they bowed down. 8 Eʹsau said: “What
is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that I have met?“ He replied:
“In order to find favor in the eyes of my lord.“ 9 Then Eʹsau said: “I
have a great many possessions, my brother. Keep what is yours.“ 10 However,
Jacob said: “No, please. If I have found favor in your eyes, you must take
my gift from my hand, because I brought it so that I could see your face. And
I have seen your face as though seeing God’s face, in that you received me
with pleasure. 11 Take, please, the gift conveying my blessing that was
brought to you, for God has favored me and I have everything I need.“ And he
continued to urge him, so that he took it. 12 Later Eʹsau said: “Let us
move out and go, and let me go in advance of you.“ 13 But he said to him:
“My lord is aware that the children are delicate and that in my care are
sheep and cattle nursing their young. If they are driven too quickly for one
day, then the whole flock will die. 14 Let my lord, please, go on ahead of his
servant, but I will continue the journey more slowly at the pace of my
livestock and of the children until I come to my lord at Seʹir.“ 15 Then
Eʹsau said: “Please, let me leave some of my people with you.“ To this he
said: “Why do this? Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.“ 16 So
that day Eʹsau went on his way back to Seʹir. 17 And Jacob journeyed to
Sucʹcoth, and he built a house for himself and he made shelters for his herd.
That was why he named the place Sucʹcoth. 18 After journeying from
Padʹdan-aʹram, Jacob arrived safely at the city of Sheʹchem in the land of
Caʹnaan, and he set up his camp near the city. 19 Then he acquired a portion
of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of Haʹmor, the father of
Sheʹchem, for 100 pieces of money. 20 There he set up an altar and called it
God, the God of Israel. |34| Now Diʹnah, Jacob’s daughter by Leʹah, used
to go out to spend time with the young women of the land. 2 When Sheʹchem,
the son of Haʹmor the Hiʹvite, a chieftain of the land, saw her, he took her
and lay down with her and violated her. 3 And he became very attached to
Diʹnah, the daughter of Jacob, and he fell in love with the young woman and
spoke persuasively to her. 4 Finally Sheʹchem said to Haʹmor his father:
“Get me this young woman to be my wife.“ 5 When Jacob heard that he had
defiled Diʹnah his daughter, his sons were with his herd in the field. So
Jacob kept silent until they returned. 6 Later Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father,
went out to speak with Jacob. 7 But the sons of Jacob heard about it and
returned from the field right away. They were offended and very angry because
he had disgraced Israel by lying down with Jacob’s daughter, something that
should not be done. 8 Haʹmor spoke with them, saying: “My son Sheʹchem
longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife, 9 and form
marriage alliances with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for
yourselves. 10 You may dwell with us, and the land will become available for
you. Dwell and carry on trade in it and settle in it.“ 11 Then Sheʹchem
said to her father and to her brothers: “Let me find favor in your eyes, and

                                       34

---

Genesis 34

I will give you whatever you ask me. 12 You can demand from me a very high
bride price and gift. I am willing to give whatever you may say to me. Just
give me the young woman as a wife.“ 13 And Jacob’s sons answered Sheʹchem
and Haʹmor his father deceitfully because he had defiled Diʹnah their
sister. 14 They said to them: “We cannot possibly do such a thing, to give
our sister to a man who is not circumcised, for that is a disgrace to us. 15
We can only consent on this condition: that you become like us and circumcise
all your males. 16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take
your daughters for ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one
people. 17 But if you do not listen to us and get circumcised, then we will
take our daughter and go.“ 18 Their words pleased Haʹmor and Sheʹchem,
Haʹmor’s son. 19 The young man did not delay in doing what they asked,
because he found delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was the most honorable
of the whole house of his father. 20 So Haʹmor and his son Sheʹchem went to
the city gate and spoke to the men of their city, saying: 21 “These men wish
to be at peace with us. Let them dwell in the land and carry on trade in it,
for the land is large enough to accommodate them. We can take their daughters
as wives, and our daughters we can give to them. 22 Only on this one condition
will the men consent to dwell with us in order to become one people: that
every male among us be circumcised just the way they are circumcised. 23 Then,
will not their possessions, their wealth, and all their livestock be ours? So
let us give them our consent that they may dwell with us.“ 24 All those
going out by the gate of his city listened to Haʹmor and to his son
Sheʹchem, and all the males got circumcised, all those going out of the city
gate. 25 However, on the third day, when they were still in pain, two sons of
Jacob, Simʹe·on and Leʹvi, Diʹnah’s brothers, each took his sword and
went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male. 26 They killed Haʹmor
and his son Sheʹchem with the sword and then took Diʹnah from Sheʹchem’s
house and left. 27 Jacob’s other sons came upon the slain men and plundered
the city because they had defiled their sister. 28 They took their flocks,
their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. 29
They also took all their possessions, captured all their little children and
their wives, and plundered everything in the houses. 30 At this Jacob said to
Simʹe·on and to Leʹvi: “You have brought great trouble on me in making me
a stench to the inhabitants of the land, to the Caʹnaan·ites and the
Perʹiz·zites. I am few in number, and they will certainly gather together to
attack me and I will be annihilated, I and my house.“ 31 But they said:
“Should anyone treat our sister like a prostitute?“ |35| After that God
said to Jacob: “Rise, go up to Bethʹel and dwell there, and make an altar
there to the true God, who appeared to you when you were running away from
Eʹsau your brother.“ 2 Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were
with him: “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst, and cleanse
yourselves and change your garments, 3 and let us rise and go up to Bethʹel.
There I will make an altar to the true God, who answered me in the day of my
distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.“ 4 So they gave
Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears,
and Jacob buried them under the big tree that was close to Sheʹchem. 5 When
they traveled on, the terror of God struck the cities around them, so they did
not chase after the sons of Jacob. 6 Jacob eventually came to Luz, that is,
Bethʹel, in the land of Caʹnaan, he and all the people with him. 7 There he
built an altar and called the place El-bethʹel, because there the true God
had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother. 8 Later

Genesis 35

Debʹo·rah, Re·bekʹah’s nurse, died and was buried at the foot of
Bethʹel under an oak. So he named it Alʹlon-bacʹuth. 9 God appeared to
Jacob once again while he was coming from Padʹdan-aʹram and blessed him. 10
God said to him: “Your name is Jacob. Your name will no longer be Jacob, but
Israel will be your name.“ And he began to call him Israel. 11 God further
said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and become many. Nations and a
congregation of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you. 
12 As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will
give it, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.“ 13 Then God
went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him. 14 So Jacob set up
a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he
poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. 15 And Jacob continued to
call the place where God had spoken with him Bethʹel. 16 Then they pulled
away from Bethʹel. And while they were still some distance from Ephʹrath,
Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was very difficult. 17 But while she
was struggling to deliver the child, the midwife said to her: “Do not be
afraid, for you will have this son also.“ 18 Just as her life was slipping
away (for she was dying), she named him Ben-oʹni, but his father called him
Benjamin. 19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephʹrath, that is,
Bethʹle·hem. 20 Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of
Rachel’s grave to this day. 21 After that Israel pulled away and pitched his
tent a distance beyond the tower of Eʹder. 22 Once while Israel was dwelling
in that land, Reuʹben went and lay down with Bilʹhah his father’s
concubine, and Israel heard about it.
So there were 12 sons of Jacob. 23 The
sons by Leʹah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuʹben, then Simʹe·on, Leʹvi,
Judah, Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun. 24 The sons by Rachel were Joseph and
Benjamin. 25 And the sons by Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and
Naphʹta·li. 26 And the sons by Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, were Gad and
Ashʹer. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Padʹdan-aʹram. 27
Jacob eventually came to where his father Isaac was at Mamʹre, to
Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, where Abraham and also Isaac had
resided as foreigners. 28 Isaac lived to be 180 years old. 29 Then Isaac
breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, after a long and
satisfying life; and his sons Eʹsau and Jacob buried him. |36| This is the
history of Eʹsau, that is, Eʹdom. 2 Eʹsau took his wives from the daughters
of Caʹnaan: Aʹdah the daughter of Eʹlon the Hitʹtite; and
O·hol·i·baʹmah the daughter of Aʹnah, the granddaughter of Zibʹe·on the
Hiʹvite; 3 and Basʹe·math, Ishʹma·el’s daughter, the sister of
Ne·baʹioth. 4 And Aʹdah bore Elʹi·phaz to Eʹsau, and Basʹe·math bore
Reuʹel, 5 and O·hol·i·baʹmah bore Jeʹush, Jaʹlam, and Korʹah.
These
are the sons of Eʹsau, who were born to him in the land of Caʹnaan. 6 After
that Eʹsau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the members of his
household, his herd and all his other beasts, and all the wealth he had
accumulated in the land of Caʹnaan and he went to another land some distance
away from Jacob his brother. 7 For their goods had become too many for them to
dwell together, and the land where they were residing was not able to sustain
them because of their herds. 8 So Eʹsau took up dwelling in the mountainous
region of Seʹir. Eʹsau is Eʹdom. 9 And this is the history of Eʹsau the
father of Eʹdom in the mountainous region of Seʹir. 10 These are the names
of the sons of Eʹsau: Elʹi·phaz the son of Aʹdah, Eʹsau’s wife; Reuʹel
the son of Basʹe·math, Eʹsau’s wife. 11 The sons of Elʹi·phaz were
Teʹman, Oʹmar, Zeʹpho, Gaʹtam, and Keʹnaz. 12 Timʹna became the

Genesis 36

concubine of Elʹi·phaz, Eʹsau’s son. In time she bore to Elʹi·phaz,
Amʹa·lek. These are the sons of Aʹdah, Eʹsau’s wife. 13 These are the
sons of Reuʹel: Naʹhath, Zeʹrah, Shamʹmah, and Mizʹzah. These were the
sons of Basʹe·math, Eʹsau’s wife. 14 These were the sons of
O·hol·i·baʹmah the daughter of Aʹnah, the granddaughter of Zibʹe·on,
Eʹsau’s wife, whom she bore to Eʹsau: Jeʹush, Jaʹlam, and Korʹah. 15
These are the sheikhs of the sons of Eʹsau: The sons of Elʹi·phaz,
Eʹsau’s firstborn: Sheikh Teʹman, Sheikh Oʹmar, Sheikh Zeʹpho, Sheikh
Keʹnaz, 16 Sheikh Korʹah, Sheikh Gaʹtam, and Sheikh Amʹa·lek. These are
the sheikhs of Elʹi·phaz in the land of Eʹdom. These are the sons by
Aʹdah. 17 These are the sons of Reuʹel, Eʹsau’s son: Sheikh Naʹhath,
Sheikh Zeʹrah, Sheikh Shamʹmah, and Sheikh Mizʹzah. These are the sheikhs
of Reuʹel in the land of Eʹdom. These are the sons by Basʹe·math,
Eʹsau’s wife. 18 Finally these are the sons of O·hol·i·baʹmah,
Eʹsau’s wife: Sheikh Jeʹush, Sheikh Jaʹlam, and Sheikh Korʹah. These are
the sheikhs of O·hol·i·baʹmah the daughter of Aʹnah, Eʹsau’s wife. 19
These are the sons of Eʹsau, and these are their sheikhs. He is Eʹdom. 20
These are the sons of Seʹir the Horʹite, the inhabitants of the land:
Loʹtan, Shoʹbal, Zibʹe·on, Aʹnah, 21 Diʹshon, Eʹzer, and Diʹshan.
These are the sheikhs of the Horʹites, the sons of Seʹir, in the land of
Eʹdom. 22 The sons of Loʹtan were Hoʹri and Heʹmam, and Loʹtan’s sister
was Timʹna. 23 These are the sons of Shoʹbal: Alʹvan, Manʹa·hath, Eʹbal,
Sheʹpho, and Oʹnam. 24 These are the sons of Zibʹe·on: Aʹiah and Aʹnah.
This is the Aʹnah who found the hot springs in the wilderness while he was
tending the donkeys for Zibʹe·on his father. 25 These are the children of
Aʹnah: Diʹshon and O·hol·i·baʹmah the daughter of Aʹnah. 26 These are
the sons of Diʹshon: Hemʹdan, Eshʹban, Ithʹran, and Cheʹran. 27 These are
the sons of Eʹzer: Bilʹhan, Zaʹa·van, and Aʹkan. 28 These are the sons of
Diʹshan: Uz and Aʹran. 29 These are the sheikhs of the Horʹites: Sheikh
Loʹtan, Sheikh Shoʹbal, Sheikh Zibʹe·on, Sheikh Aʹnah, 30 Sheikh
Diʹshon, Sheikh Eʹzer, and Sheikh Diʹshan. These are the sheikhs of the
Horʹites according to their sheikhs in the land of Seʹir. 31 Now these are
the kings who reigned in the land of Eʹdom before any king reigned over the
Israelites. 32 Beʹla son of Beʹor reigned in Eʹdom, and the name of his
city was Dinʹha·bah. 33 When Beʹla died, Joʹbab son of Zeʹrah from
Bozʹrah began to reign in his place. 34 When Joʹbab died, Huʹsham from the
land of the Teʹman·ites began to reign in his place. 35 When Huʹsham died,
Haʹdad son of Beʹdad, who defeated the Midʹi·an·ites in the territory of
Moʹab, began to reign in his place, and the name of his city was Aʹvith. 36
When Haʹdad died, Samʹlah from Mas·reʹkah began to reign in his place. 37
When Samʹlah died, Shaʹul from Re·hoʹboth by the River began to reign in
his place. 38 When Shaʹul died, Baʹal-haʹnan the son of Achʹbor began to
reign in his place. 39 When Baʹal-haʹnan the son of Achʹbor died, Haʹdar
began to reign in his place. The name of his city was Paʹu, and the name of
his wife was Me·hetʹa·bel the daughter of Maʹtred the daughter of
Meʹza·hab. 40 So these are the names of the sheikhs of Eʹsau according to
their families, according to their places, by their names: Sheikh Timʹna,
Sheikh Alʹvah, Sheikh Jeʹtheth, 41 Sheikh O·hol·i·baʹmah, Sheikh Eʹlah,
Sheikh Piʹnon, 42 Sheikh Keʹnaz, Sheikh Teʹman, Sheikh Mibʹzar, 43 Sheikh
Magʹdi·el, and Sheikh Iʹram. These are the sheikhs of Eʹdom according to
their settlements in the land of their possession. This is Eʹsau the father
of Eʹdom. |37| Jacob continued to dwell in the land of Caʹnaan, where his

Genesis 37

father had lived as a foreigner. 2 This is the history of Jacob.
When Joseph
was 17 years old, the young man was tending the flock with the sons of
Bilʹhah and the sons of Zilʹpah, the wives of his father. And Joseph brought
a bad report about them to their father. 3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than
all his other sons because he was the son of his old age, and he had a special
robe made for him. 4 When his brothers saw that their father loved him more
than all his brothers, they began to hate him, and they could not speak
peaceably to him. 5 Later Joseph had a dream and told it to his brothers, and
they found further reason to hate him. 6 He said to them: “Please listen to
this dream that I had. 7 There we were binding sheaves in the middle of the
field when my sheaf got up and stood erect and your sheaves encircled and
bowed down to my sheaf.“ 8 His brothers said to him: “Are you really going
to make yourself king over us and dominate us?“ So they found another reason
to hate him, because of his dreams and what he said. 9 After that he had still
another dream, and he related it to his brothers: “I have had another dream.
This time the sun and the moon and 11 stars were bowing down to me.“ 10 Then
he related it to his father as well as his brothers, and his father rebuked
him and said to him: “What is the meaning of this dream of yours? Am I as
well as your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the
earth to you?“ 11 And his brothers grew jealous of him, but his father kept
the saying in mind. 12 His brothers now went to pasture their father’s flock
near Sheʹchem. 13 Israel later said to Joseph: “Your brothers are tending
flocks near Sheʹchem, are they not? Come, and let me send you to them.“ At
this he said to him: “I am ready!“ 14 So he said to him: “Go, please,
and see whether your brothers are well. See how the flock is, and bring word
back to me.“ With that he sent him away from the valley of Hebʹron, and he
went on toward Sheʹchem. 15 Later a man found him as he was wandering in a
field. The man asked him: “What are you looking for?“ 16 To this he said:
“I am looking for my brothers. Please tell me, where are they tending
flocks?“ 17 The man continued: “They have pulled away from here, for I
heard them saying, ‘Let us go to Doʹthan.’“ So Joseph went after his
brothers and found them at Doʹthan. 18 Now they caught sight of him from a
distance, and before he reached them, they began plotting against him to put
him to death. 19 So they said to one another: “Look! Here comes that
dreamer. 20 Come, now, let us kill him and pitch him into one of the
waterpits, and we will say that a vicious wild animal devoured him. Then let
us see what will become of his dreams.“ 21 When Reuʹben heard this, he
tried to rescue him from them. So he said: “Let us not take his life.“ 22
Reuʹben said to them: “Do not shed blood. Throw him into this waterpit in
the wilderness, but do not harm him.“ His purpose was to rescue him from
them in order to return him to his father. 23 So as soon as Joseph came to his
brothers, they stripped Joseph of his robe, the special robe that he wore, 24
and they took him and threw him into the waterpit. At the time the pit was
empty; there was no water in it. 25 Then they sat down to eat. When they
looked up, there was a caravan of Ishʹma·el·ites coming from Gilʹe·ad.
Their camels were carrying labdanum gum, balsam, and resinous bark, and they
were on their way down to Egypt. 26 At this Judah said to his brothers:
“What profit would there be if we killed our brother and covered over his
blood? 27 Come, now, let us sell him to the Ishʹma·el·ites, and do not let
our hand be upon him. After all, he is our brother, our flesh.“ So they
listened to their brother. 28 And when the Midʹi·an·ite merchants were
passing by, they lifted Joseph up out of the waterpit and sold him to the

                                       38

Genesis 37

Ishʹma·el·ites for 20 pieces of silver. These men took Joseph into Egypt. 
29 Later when Reuʹben returned to the waterpit and saw that Joseph was not in
the waterpit, he ripped his garments apart. 30 When he returned to his
brothers, he exclaimed: “The child is gone! And I—what am I going to
do?“ 31 So they took Joseph’s robe and slaughtered a male goat and dipped
the robe in the blood. 32 After that they sent the special robe to their
father and said: “This is what we found. Please examine whether this is your
son’s robe or not.“ 33 Then he examined it and exclaimed: “It is my
son’s robe! A vicious wild animal must have devoured him! Joseph is surely
torn to pieces!“ 34 With that Jacob ripped his garments apart and put
sackcloth around his waist and mourned his son for many days. 35 And all his
sons and all his daughters kept trying to comfort him, but he kept refusing to
take comfort, saying: “I will go down into the Grave mourning my son!“ And
his father continued weeping for him. 36 Now the Midʹi·an·ites sold him in
Egypt to Potʹi·phar, a court official of Pharʹaoh and the chief of the
guard. |38| About that time Judah left his brothers and pitched his tent near
an A·dulʹlam·ite man named Hiʹrah. 2 There Judah saw the daughter of a
certain Caʹnaan·ite named Shuʹa. So he took her and had relations with her,
3 and she became pregnant. Later she bore a son, and he named him Er. 4 Again
she became pregnant and bore a son and named him Oʹnan. 5 Yet again she bore
a son and named him Sheʹlah. He was in Achʹzib when she bore him. 6 In time
Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Taʹmar. 7 But Er,
Judah’s firstborn, was displeasing to Jehovah; so Jehovah put him to death. 
8 In view of that, Judah said to Oʹnan: “Have relations with your
brother’s wife and perform brother-in-law marriage with her and raise up
offspring for your brother.“ 9 But Oʹnan knew that the offspring would not
be considered his. So when he did have relations with his brother’s wife, he
wasted his semen on the ground so as not to give offspring to his brother. 10
What he did was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, so he also put him to death. 11
Judah said to Taʹmar his daughter-in-law: “Dwell as a widow in the house of
your father until my son Sheʹlah grows up,“ for he said to himself: ‘He
too may die like his brothers.’ So Taʹmar went and stayed in her own
father’s house. 12 Some time passed, and Judah’s wife, the daughter of
Shuʹa, died. Judah kept the mourning period, and then he went to his
sheepshearers in Timʹnah with his companion Hiʹrah the A·dulʹlam·ite. 13
Taʹmar was told: “Here your father-in-law is going up to Timʹnah to shear
his sheep.“ 14 With that she removed her widow’s clothing and veiled
herself and covered herself with a shawl and sat down at the entrance of
E·naʹim, which is on the road to Timʹnah, for she saw that Sheʹlah had
grown up and yet she had not been given to him as a wife. 15 When Judah caught
sight of her, he at once took her for a prostitute, because she had covered
her face. 16 So he turned aside to her by the road and said: “Allow me,
please, to have relations with you,“ for he did not know that she was his
daughter-in-law. However, she said: “What will you give me that you may have
relations with me?“ 17 To this he said: “I will send a young goat from my
herd.“ But she said: “Will you give a security until you send it?“ 18 He
continued: “What security should I give you?“ to which she said: “Your
seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand.“ Then he gave
them to her and had relations with her, and she became pregnant by him. 19
After that she got up and went away and removed her shawl and clothed herself
with her widow’s clothing. 20 And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of
his companion the A·dulʹlam·ite, to get back the security from the hand of

                                       39

Genesis 38

the woman, but he never found her. 21 He inquired of the men of her place,
saying: “Where is that temple prostitute in E·naʹim along the road?“ But
they said: “No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.“ 22 Finally
he returned to Judah and said: “I never found her, and besides, the men of
the place said, ‘No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.’“ 23
So Judah said: “Let her take them for herself, in order that we may not fall
into contempt. At any rate, I have sent this young goat, but you never found
her.“ 24 However, about three months later, Judah was told: “Taʹmar your
daughter-in-law has acted as a prostitute, and she is also pregnant by her
prostitution.“ At that Judah said: “Bring her out and let her be
burned.“ 25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her
father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong.“ Then she
added: “Please examine to whom these belong, the seal ring and the cord and
the rod.“ 26 Then Judah examined them and said: “She is more righteous
than I am, because I did not give her to Sheʹlah my son.“ And he had no
further sexual relations with her after that. 27 When the time came for her to
give birth, there were twins in her womb. 28 As she was giving birth, one put
out his hand, and the midwife immediately took a scarlet thread and tied it
around his hand, saying: “This one came out first.“ 29 But as soon as he
drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she exclaimed: “What a breach
you have made for yourself!“ So he was named Peʹrez. 30 Afterward his
brother came out, around whose hand the scarlet thread was tied, and he was
named Zeʹrah. |39| Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and an Egyptian named
Potʹi·phar, a court official of Pharʹaoh and chief of the guard, bought him
from the Ishʹma·el·ites who had taken him down there. 2 But Jehovah was
with Joseph. As a result, he became successful and was put over the house of
his master, the Egyptian. 3 And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and
that Jehovah was making everything that he did successful. 4 Joseph kept
finding favor in his eyes, and he became his personal attendant. So he
appointed him over his house, and he put him in charge of all that was his. 5
From the time he appointed him over his house and in charge of all that was
his, Jehovah kept blessing the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph, and
Jehovah’s blessing came to be on all that he had in the house and in the
field. 6 He eventually left everything that was his in Joseph’s care, and he
gave no thought to anything except the food he was eating. Moreover, Joseph
grew to be well-built and handsome. 7 Now after these things, the wife of his
master began to cast her eyes on Joseph and say: “Lie down with me.“ 8 But
he refused and said to his master’s wife: “Here my master does not know
what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted everything he has into my
care. 9 There is no one greater in this house than I am, and he has not
withheld from me anything at all except you, because you are his wife. So how
could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?“ 10 So day
after day she spoke to Joseph, but he never consented to lie with her or to
remain with her. 11 But on one of the days when he went into the house to do
his work, none of the household servants were in the house. 12 Then she
grabbed hold of him by his garment and said: “Lie down with me!“ But he
left his garment in her hand and fled outside. 13 As soon as she saw that he
had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, 14 she began to cry out
to the men of her house and to say to them: “Look! He brought to us this
Hebrew man to make us a laughingstock. He came to me to lie down with me, but
I began to cry out at the top of my voice. 15 Then as soon as he heard me
raising my voice and screaming, he left his garment beside me and fled

                                       40

Genesis 39

outside.“ 16 After that she laid his garment beside her until his master
came to his house. 17 Then she told him the same thing, saying: “The Hebrew
servant whom you brought to us came to me to make me a laughingstock. 18 But
as soon as I raised my voice and began to scream, he left his garment beside
me and fled outside.“ 19 As soon as his master heard the words his wife
spoke to him, saying: “These are the things your servant did to me,“ his
anger blazed. 20 So Joseph’s master took him and gave him over to the
prison, the place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest, and
he remained there in the prison. 21 But Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept
showing loyal love to him and granting him favor in the eyes of the chief
officer of the prison. 22 So the chief officer of the prison put Joseph in
charge of all the prisoners in the prison, and everything that they were doing
there, he was the one having it done. 23 The chief officer of the prison was
looking after absolutely nothing that was in Joseph’s care, for Jehovah was
with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful. |40| After these
things, the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker sinned
against their lord, the king of Egypt. 2 So Pharʹaoh grew indignant at his
two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 3 and he committed them
to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard, to the place where Joseph
was a prisoner. 4 Then the chief of the guard assigned Joseph to be with them
and to take care of them, and they remained in jail for some time. 5 The
cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison,
each had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own interpretation.
6 The next morning, when Joseph came in and saw them, they looked dejected. 7
So he asked the officers of Pharʹaoh who were in custody with him in his
master’s house: “Why are your faces gloomy today?“ 8 At this they said
to him: “We each had a dream, but there is no interpreter with us.“ Joseph
said to them: “Do not interpretations belong to God? Relate it to me,
please.“ 9 So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, saying to
him: “In my dream, there was a vine before me. 10 And on the vine, there
were three twigs, and as it was sprouting shoots, it blossomed, and its
clusters ripened into grapes. 11 And Pharʹaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I
took the grapes and squeezed them out into Pharʹaoh’s cup. After that I put
the cup in Pharʹaoh’s hand.“ 12 Then Joseph said to him: “This is its
interpretation: The three twigs are three days. 13 Three days from now,
Pharʹaoh will bring you out, restoring you to your office, and you will put
Pharʹaoh’s cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer.
14 Nevertheless, you must remember me when things go well with you. Please
show me loyal love and mention me to Pharʹaoh, in order to get me out of this
place. 15 I was, in fact, kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have
not done anything here for which they should put me in prison.“ 16 When the
chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted something good, he said to him:
“I too was in my dream, and there were three baskets of white bread on my
head, 17 and in the top basket, there were all sorts of baked goods for
Pharʹaoh, and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my
head.“ 18 Then Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three
baskets are three days. 19 Three days from now, Pharʹaoh will behead you and
will hang you on a stake, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.“ 20
Now the third day was Pharʹaoh’s birthday, and he made a feast for all his
servants, and he brought out both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in
the presence of his servants. 21 And he returned the chief cupbearer to his
post of cupbearer, and he continued to hand the cup to Pharʹaoh. 22 But he

                                       41

Genesis 40

hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23 However,
the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he kept forgetting him. |41| At
the end of two full years, Pharʹaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile
River. 2 And there, coming up from the river, were seven fine-looking, fat
cows, and they were feeding on the Nile grass. 3 There were seven other cows
that looked ugly and thin coming up after them from the Nile, and they stood
alongside the fat cows by the bank of the Nile. 4 Then the ugly, thin cows
began to eat up the seven fine-looking, fat cows. At this Pharʹaoh woke up. 5
Then he went back to sleep and had a second dream. There were seven ears of
grain coming up on one stalk, full and choice. 6 And growing up after them
were seven ears of grain that were thin and scorched by the east wind. 7 And
the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven full and choice ears of
grain. At this Pharʹaoh woke up and realized that it was a dream. 8 But in
the morning, his spirit became agitated. So he sent for all the
magic-practicing priests of Egypt and all her wise men. Pharʹaoh related his
dreams to them, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharʹaoh. 9
At that the chief cupbearer spoke with Pharʹaoh, saying: “I am confessing
my sins today. 10 Pharʹaoh was indignant at his servants. So he committed me
to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard, both me and the chief
baker. 11 After that we each had a dream on the same night. He and I each had
a dream with its own interpretation. 12 And there with us was a young Hebrew
man, a servant of the chief of the guard. When we related them to him, he
interpreted for us the meaning of each dream. 13 It happened exactly as he had
interpreted to us. I was restored to my office, but the other man was
hanged.“ 14 So Pharʹaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him quickly from
the prison. He shaved and changed his clothes and went in to Pharʹaoh. 15
Then Pharʹaoh said to Joseph: “I had a dream, but there is no one to
interpret it. Now I have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and
interpret it.“ 16 At this Joseph answered Pharʹaoh: “I need not be
considered! God will speak concerning Pharʹaoh’s welfare.“ 17 Pharʹaoh
went on to say to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the
Nile River. 18 And there, coming up from the Nile, were seven fine-looking,
fat cows, and they began to feed on the Nile grass. 19 And there were seven
other cows coming up after them, poor and very bad-looking and thin. I have
never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt. 20 And the skinny,
bad cows began to eat up the first seven fat cows. 21 But when they had
consumed them, no one could have known that they had done so, since their
appearance was just as bad as at the start. At that I woke up. 22 “After
that I saw in my dream seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk, full and
choice. 23 Growing up after them were seven ears of shriveled grain, thin and
scorched by the east wind. 24 Then the thin ears of grain began to swallow up
the seven choice ears of grain. So I told it to the magic-practicing priests,
but there was no one who could explain it to me.“ 25 Then Joseph said to
Pharʹaoh: “The dreams of Pharʹaoh are one and the same. The true God has
told to Pharʹaoh what He will do. 26 The seven good cows are seven years.
Likewise, the seven good ears of grain are seven years. The dreams are one and
the same. 27 The seven skinny and bad cows that came up after them are seven
years, and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, will
prove to be seven years of famine. 28 This is just as I told to Pharʹaoh: The
true God has caused Pharʹaoh to see what He will do. 29 “There are to be
seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt. 30 But seven years of
famine will certainly arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of

                                       42

Genesis 41

Egypt will certainly be forgotten, and the famine will exhaust the land. 31
And the previous abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the
famine afterward, for it will be very severe. 32 The dream was given twice to
Pharʹaoh because the matter has been firmly established by the true God, and
the true God will soon carry it out. 33 “So now let Pharʹaoh look for a man
who is discreet and wise and place him over the land of Egypt. 34 Let
Pharʹaoh take action and appoint overseers in the land, and he should collect
one fifth of the produce of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 35 And
let them collect all the food during these coming good years, and let them
stockpile grain under Pharʹaoh’s authority as food to be stored in the
cities and safeguarded there. 36 The food should serve as a supply for the
land for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt, so
that the land may not perish in the famine.“ 37 This proposal seemed good to
Pharʹaoh and all his servants. 38 So Pharʹaoh said to his servants: “Can
another man be found like this one in whom there is the spirit of God?“ 39
Pharʹaoh then said to Joseph: “Since God has caused you to know all of
this, there is no one as discreet and wise as you. 40 You will personally be
over my house, and all my people will obey you implicitly. Only in my role as
king will I be greater than you.“ 41 And Pharʹaoh added to Joseph: “See,
I am putting you over all the land of Egypt.“ 42 Then Pharʹaoh removed his
signet ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph’s hand and clothed him
with garments of fine linen and placed a necklace of gold around his neck. 43
Moreover, he had him ride in the second chariot of honor that he had, and they
would call out ahead of him,  44 Pharʹaoh further said to Joseph: “I am
Pharʹaoh, but without your authorization, no man may do a single thing in all
the land of Egypt.“ 45 After that Pharʹaoh gave Joseph the name
Zaphʹe·nath-pa·neʹah and gave him Asʹe·nath the daughter of
Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On as a wife. And Joseph began to oversee the
land of Egypt. 46 Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharʹaoh king
of Egypt.
Then Joseph went out from before Pharʹaoh and traveled throughout
all the land of Egypt. 47 And during the seven years of abundance, the land
went on producing plentifully. 48 And he kept collecting all the food of the
seven years from the land of Egypt, and he would stockpile the food in the
cities. In each city he would store the food from the fields around it. 49
Joseph continued stockpiling grain in very great quantity, like the sand of
the sea, until finally they gave up measuring it because it could not be
measured. 50 Before the year of the famine arrived, two sons were born to
Joseph, whom Asʹe·nath the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On bore
to him. 51 Joseph named the firstborn Ma·nasʹseh, for he said, “God has
made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father.“ 52 And he
named the second one Eʹphra·im, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in
the land of my affliction.“ 53 Then the seven years of abundance in the land
of Egypt ended, 54 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had
said. The famine developed in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt
there was bread. 55 Eventually, all the land of Egypt suffered from the
famine, and the people began to cry to Pharʹaoh for bread. Then Pharʹaoh
said to all the Egyptians: “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.“ 
56 The famine continued over all the surface of the earth. Then Joseph began
to open up all the granaries that were among them and to sell to the
Egyptians, as the famine had a strong grip on the land of Egypt. 57 Moreover,
people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy from Joseph, because the famine
had a strong grip on all the earth. |42| When Jacob learned that there was

                                       43

Genesis 42

grain in Egypt, he said to his sons: “Why do you just keep looking at one
another?“ 2 He added: “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down
there and buy some for us, so that we may stay alive and not die.“ 3 So ten
of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 4 But Jacob did not
send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his other brothers, for he said:
“Perhaps a fatal accident may befall him.“ 5 So Israel’s sons came along
with the others who were coming to buy, because the famine had extended to the
land of Caʹnaan. 6 Joseph was the man in authority over the land, and he was
the one who sold grain to all the people of the earth. So Joseph’s brothers
came and bowed low to him with their faces to the ground. 7 When Joseph saw
his brothers, he immediately recognized them, but he concealed his identity
from them. So he spoke harshly with them and said: “Where have you come
from?“ to which they said: “From the land of Caʹnaan to buy food.“ 8
Thus Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 9 Joseph
immediately remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said
to them: “You are spies! You have come to see the vulnerable areas of the
land!“ 10 Then they said to him: “No, my lord, but your servants have come
to buy food. 11 We are all sons of but one man. We are upright men. Your
servants do not act as spies.“ 12 But he said to them: “Not so! You have
come to see the vulnerable areas of the land!“ 13 At this they said: “Your
servants are 12 brothers. We are the sons of but one man in the land of
Caʹnaan, and the youngest is now with our father, whereas the other one is no
more.“ 14 However, Joseph said to them: “It is just as I said to
you—‘You are spies!’ 15 By this you will be tested: As surely as
Pharʹaoh lives, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother
comes here. 16 Send one of you to bring your brother while you remain in
bondage. In this way, your words may be tested out to see if you are telling
the truth. And if not, then, as surely as Pharʹaoh lives, you are spies.“ 
17 With that he put them together in custody for three days. 18 Joseph said to
them on the third day: “Do this and live, for I fear God. 19 If you are
upright, let one of your brothers remain in bondage in your house of custody,
but the rest of you may go and take grain to alleviate the famine in your
households. 20 Then bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words will
be found trustworthy and you will not die.“ And they did so. 21 And they
said to one another: “We are surely being punished on account of our
brother, because we saw his distress when he begged us to show compassion, but
we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.“ 22 Then
Reuʹben answered them: “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not sin against the
child,’ but you would not listen? Now his blood is certainly being asked
back.“ 23 But they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an
interpreter between them. 24 So he turned away from them and began to weep.
When he returned and spoke to them again, he took Simʹe·on from them and
bound him before their eyes. 25 Joseph then gave the command to fill up their
bags with grain and to return each man’s money to his own sack and to give
them provisions for the journey. This was done for them. 26 So they loaded
their grain on their donkeys and left from there. 27 When one of them opened
his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place, he saw his money
there in the mouth of his bag. 28 At that he said to his brothers: “My money
has been returned, and now here it is in my bag!“ Then their hearts sank,
and trembling, they turned to one another and said: “What is this that God
has done to us?“ 29 When they came to Jacob their father in the land of
Caʹnaan, they told him all the things that had befallen them, saying: 30

                                       44

Genesis 42

“The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly with us and accused us
of spying on the country. 31 But we said to him, ‘We are upright men. We are
not spies. 32 We are 12 brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more, and
the youngest is now with our father in the land of Caʹnaan.’ 33 But the man
who is the lord of the country said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are
upright: Leave one of your brothers with me. Then take something to alleviate
the famine in your households and go. 34 And bring your youngest brother to
me, so that I may know that you are not spies but upright men. I will then
give your brother back to you, and you may carry on trade in the land.’“ 
35 As they were emptying their sacks, here was each one’s bag of money in
his sack. When they and their father saw their bags of money, they became
afraid. 36 Jacob their father exclaimed to them: “It is I you have bereaved!
Joseph is no more, and Simʹe·on is no more, and you are going to take
Benjamin! It is upon me that all these things have come!“ 37 But Reuʹben
said to his father: “You may put to death my own two sons if I do not bring
him back to you. Give him over to my care, and I will return him to you.“ 38
However, he said: “My son will not go down with you, because his brother is
dead and he alone is left. If a fatal accident should befall him on the
journey you would make, then you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to
the Grave in grief.“ |43| Now the famine was severe in the land. 2 So when
they had finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father
said to them: “Return and buy a little food for us.“ 3 Then Judah said to
him: “The man clearly warned us, ‘You must not see my face again unless
your brother is with you.’ 4 If you send our brother with us, we will go
down and buy food for you. 5 But if you do not send him, we will not go down,
for the man said to us, ‘You must not see my face again unless your brother
is with you.’“ 6 And Israel asked: “Why did you have to bring this
trouble on me by telling the man that you had another brother?“ 7 They
replied: “The man directly inquired concerning us and our relatives, saying,
‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ and we told him
these facts. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your
brother down’?“ 8 Judah then urged Israel his father: “Send the boy with
me, and let us go on our way so that we may live and not die—we and you and
our children. 9 I will be a guarantee for his safety. You may hold me
responsible. If I fail to return him to you and present him to you, I will
have sinned against you for all time. 10 But if we had not delayed, we could
have been there and back twice by now.“ 11 So Israel their father said to
them: “If it must be so, then do this: Take the finest products of the land
in your bags and carry them down to the man as a gift: a little balsam, a
little honey, labdanum, resinous bark, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 12 Take
double the money with you; and also take back the money that was returned in
the mouth of your bags. Maybe it was a mistake. 13 Take your brother and go,
return to the man. 14 May God Almighty grant you pity from the man, so that he
may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. But as for me, if I must
be bereaved, I will be bereaved!“ 15 So the men took this gift, and they
took double the money in their hand and Benjamin. Then they rose and went on
their way down to Egypt and again stood before Joseph. 16 When Joseph saw
Benjamin with them, he at once said to the man who was over his house: “Take
the men to the house and slaughter animals and prepare the meal, for the men
are to eat with me at noon.“ 17 Immediately the man did just as Joseph had
said, and he took them to Joseph’s house. 18 But the men became afraid when
they were taken to Joseph’s house, and they began to say: “It is because

                                       45

Genesis 43

of the money that was returned in our bags the last time that we are being
brought here. Now they will attack us and make us slaves and take our
donkeys!“ 19 So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and
spoke to him at the entrance of the house. 20 They said: “Pardon us, my
lord! We did come down the first time to buy food. 21 But when we arrived at
our lodging place and began opening our bags, why, here was the money of each
one in the mouth of his bag, our money in full weight. So we would like to
return it personally. 22 And we have brought more money to buy food. We do not
know who placed our money in our bags.“ 23 Then he said: “It is all right.
Do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father put treasure in your
bags. Your money came first to me.“ After that he brought out Simʹe·on to
them. 24 Then the man brought them into Joseph’s house and gave them water
for washing their feet, and he gave fodder for their donkeys. 25 And they
prepared the gift for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they
were going to eat a meal there. 26 When Joseph went into the house, they
brought their gift to him into the house and prostrated themselves to him to
the ground. 27 After this he inquired about their welfare and said: “How is
your aged father of whom you have spoken? Is he still alive?“ 28 To this
they said: “Your servant our father is well. He is still alive.“ Then they
bowed down and prostrated themselves. 29 When he looked up and saw Benjamin
his brother, the son of his mother, he said: “Is this your brother, the
youngest one of whom you have spoken to me?“ He added: “May God show you
his favor, my son.“ 30 Joseph then hurried out, because he was overcome with
emotion for his brother, and he looked for a place to weep. So he went into a
private room and gave way to tears there. 31 After that he washed his face and
went out, now in control of himself, and he said: “Serve the meal.“ 32
They served him by himself and them by themselves, and the Egyptians with him
ate by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews,
because that is a detestable thing to the Egyptians. 33 The brothers were
seated before him, the firstborn according to his right as firstborn and the
youngest according to his youth, and they kept looking at one another in
amazement. 34 He kept sending portions of food from his table to theirs, but
he increased Benjamin’s portion five times the size of the portions of all
the others. So they continued banqueting and drinking with him to the full. 
|44| Later he commanded the man who was over his house: “Fill the bags of
the men with as much food as they can carry, and place the money of each one
in the mouth of his bag. 2 But you must place my cup, the silver cup, in the
mouth of the bag of the youngest, along with the money for his grain.“ So he
did as Joseph had instructed. 3 In the morning when it had become light, the
men were sent away with their donkeys. 4 They had not gone far from the city
when Joseph said to the man who was over his house: “Get up! Chase after the
men! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid bad for good?
5 Is not this what my master drinks from and uses to read omens expertly? It
is a wicked thing you have done.’“ 6 So he overtook them and spoke these
words to them. 7 But they said to him: “Why does my lord say such a thing?
It is unthinkable that your servants would do anything like this. 8 Why, the
money that we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the
land of Caʹnaan. How, then, could we steal silver or gold from the house of
your master? 9 If it is found with one of your slaves, let him die, and the
rest of us will also become slaves to my master.“ 10 So he said: “Let it
be as you say: The one with whom it is found will become my slave, but the
rest of you will be innocent.“ 11 With that each one quickly lowered his bag

                                       46

Genesis 44

to the ground and opened it. 12 He searched carefully, starting with the
oldest and finishing with the youngest. Finally the cup was found in
Benjamin’s bag. 13 Then they ripped their garments apart, and each of them
lifted his load back onto his donkey and returned to the city. 14 When Judah
and his brothers went into Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell
to the ground before him. 15 Joseph said to them: “What is this deed that
you have done? Did you not know that a man like me can expertly read omens?“
16 At this Judah replied: “What can we say to my master? What can we speak?
And how can we prove ourselves righteous? The true God has found out the error
of your slaves. We are now slaves to my master, both we and the one in whose
hand the cup was found!“ 17 However, he said: “It is unthinkable for me to
do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found is the one who will become a
slave to me. As for the rest of you, go up in peace to your father.“ 18
Judah now approached him and said: “I beg you, my master, please let your
slave speak a word in my master’s ears, and do not become angry with your
slave, for you are like Pharʹaoh himself. 19 My master asked his slaves,
‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 20 So we said to my master, ‘We do
have an aged father and a child of his old age, the youngest. But his brother
is dead, so he is the only remaining son of his mother, and his father loves
him.’ 21 After that you said to your slaves, ‘Bring him down to me so that
I may see him.’ 22 But we said to my master, ‘The boy is not able to leave
his father. If he did leave him, his father would certainly die.’ 23 Then
you said to your slaves, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you,
you may not see my face anymore.’ 24 “So we went up to your slave my
father and told him the words of my master. 25 Later our father said,
‘Return and buy a little food for us.’ 26 But we said, ‘We are not able
to go down. If our youngest brother is with us we will go down, for we cannot
see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 27 Then your
slave my father said to us, ‘You well know that my wife bore but two sons to
me. 28 But one of them left me and I said: “He must surely have been torn to
pieces!“ and I have not seen him until now. 29 If you were to take this one
also out of my sight and a fatal accident were to befall him, you would
certainly bring down my gray hairs to the Grave with calamity.’ 30 “And
now if I return to your slave my father without the boy along with us, since
his own life is bound up with this one’s life, 31 then as soon as he sees
that the boy is not there, he will die, and your slaves will indeed bring down
the gray hairs of your slave our father to the Grave in grief. 32 Your slave
gave a guarantee to my father for the boy, saying, ‘If I fail to bring him
back to you, then I will have sinned against my father forever.’ 33 So now,
please, let your slave stay instead of the boy as my master’s slave, in
order that the boy may return with his brothers. 34 How can I return to my
father without the boy along with me? I could not bear looking on when this
calamity befalls my father!“ |45| At this Joseph could no longer control
himself before all his attendants. So he cried out: “Have everyone leave
me!“ No one else stayed with him while Joseph made himself known to his
brothers. 2 Then he began to weep so loudly that the Egyptians heard it and
Pharʹaoh’s house heard it. 3 Finally Joseph said to his brothers: “I am
Joseph. Is my father still alive?“ But his brothers were unable to answer
him at all, because they were astonished on account of him. 4 So Joseph said
to his brothers: “Come close to me, please.“ With that they came close to
him.
Then he said: “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5
But now do not be upset and do not reproach one another because you sold me

                                       47

Genesis 45

here; because God has sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life. 6
This is the second year of the famine in the land, and there are yet five
years in which there will be no plowing or harvest. 7 But God sent me ahead of
you in order to preserve for you a remnant on the earth and to keep you alive
by a great deliverance. 8 So, then, it was not you who sent me here, but it
was the true God, in order to appoint me as chief adviser to Pharʹaoh and
lord for all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 9 “Return
quickly to my father, and you must say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph
has said: “God has appointed me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me. Do not
delay. 10 You must dwell in the land of Goʹshen, where you will be near
me—you, your sons, your grandsons, your flocks, your herds, and everything
you have. 11 I will supply you with food there, for there are yet five years
of famine. Otherwise, you and your house and everything you have will come to
poverty.“’ 12 You and my brother Benjamin can now see with your own eyes
that I am really the one speaking to you. 13 So you must tell my father about
all my glory in Egypt and everything you have seen. Now hurry and bring my
father down here.“ 14 Then he embraced his brother Benjamin and gave way to
weeping, and Benjamin wept with his arms around his neck. 15 And he kissed all
his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers spoke with him. 
16 The news reached the house of Pharʹaoh: “Joseph’s brothers have
come!“ It was good in the eyes of Pharʹaoh and his servants. 17 So
Pharʹaoh said to Joseph: “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your beasts
of burden and go to the land of Caʹnaan, 18 and take your father and your
households and come here to me. I will give you the good things of the land of
Egypt, and you will eat the richest part of the land.’ 19 And you are
commanded to tell them: ‘Do this: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for
your children and your wives, and you must bring your father on one of them
and come here. 20 Do not worry about your belongings, for the best of all the
land of Egypt is yours.’“ 21 And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph
gave them wagons according to Pharʹaoh’s orders, and he gave them
provisions for the journey. 22 To each of them he gave individual changes of
clothing, but to Benjamin he gave 300 silver pieces and five changes of
clothing. 23 And to his father he sent the following: ten donkeys carrying
good things of Egypt and ten female donkeys carrying grain and bread and
sustenance for his father for the journey. 24 So he sent his brothers off, and
as they departed, he said to them: “Do not become upset with one another on
the way.“ 25 Then they went up from Egypt and came into the land of Caʹnaan
to their father Jacob. 26 Then they reported to him: “Joseph is still alive,
and he is the ruler over all the land of Egypt!“ But his heart grew numb
because he did not believe them. 27 When they went on telling him all the
words that Joseph had spoken to them and when he saw the wagons that Joseph
had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob began to revive. 28
Israel exclaimed: “It is enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and
see him before I die!“ |46| So Israel took all that he had and departed.
When he arrived at Beʹer-sheʹba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his
father Isaac. 2 Then God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said:
“Jacob, Jacob!“ to which he said: “Here I am!“ 3 He said: “I am the
true God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for
there I will make you into a great nation. 4 I myself will go down with you to
Egypt, and I myself will also bring you back from there, and Joseph will lay
his hand on your eyes.“ 5 After that Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba, and
the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father and their children and their

Genesis 46

wives in the wagons that Pharʹaoh had sent to transport him. 6 They took
along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of
Caʹnaan. And so they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him. 7
He brought with him into Egypt his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and
his granddaughters—all his offspring. 8 Now these are the names of
Israel’s sons who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn
was Reuʹben. 9 The sons of Reuʹben were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and
Carʹmi. 10 The sons of Simʹe·on were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin, Oʹhad, Jaʹchin,
Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman. 11 The sons of Leʹvi
were Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi. 12 The sons of Judah were Er,
Oʹnan, Sheʹlah, Peʹrez, and Zeʹrah. However, Er and Oʹnan died in the
land of Caʹnaan.
The sons of Peʹrez came to be Hezʹron and Haʹmul. 13 The
sons of Isʹsa·char were Toʹla, Puʹvah, Iob, and Shimʹron. 14 The sons of
Zebʹu·lun were Seʹred, Eʹlon, and Jahʹle·el. 15 These are the sons of
Leʹah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padʹdan-aʹram, together with his daughter
Diʹnah. All his sons and his daughters numbered 33. 16 The sons of Gad were
Ziphʹi·on, Hagʹgi, Shuʹni, Ezʹbon, Eʹri, Ar·oʹdi, and A·reʹli. 17
The sons of Ashʹer were Imʹnah, Ishʹvah, Ishʹvi, and Be·riʹah, and their
sister was Seʹrah.
The sons of Be·riʹah were Heʹber and Malʹchi·el. 18
These are the sons of Zilʹpah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Leʹah. She
bore these to Jacob: 16 persons in all. 19 The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel
were Joseph and Benjamin. 20 There were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt
Ma·nasʹseh and Eʹphra·im, whom Asʹe·nath the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra
the priest of On bore to him. 21 The sons of Benjamin were Beʹla, Beʹcher,
Ashʹbel, Geʹra, Naʹa·man, Eʹhi, Rosh, Mupʹpim, Hupʹpim, and Ard. 22
These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: 14 persons in all. 23 The
son of Dan was Huʹshim. 24 The sons of Naphʹta·li were Jahʹze·el, Guʹni,
Jeʹzer, and Shilʹlem. 25 These are the sons of Bilʹhah, whom Laʹban gave
to his daughter Rachel. She bore these to Jacob: seven persons in all. 26 All
those who descended from Jacob and went into Egypt with him, aside from the
wives of Jacob’s sons, were 66. 27 Joseph’s sons who were born to him in
Egypt were two. All the people of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were
70. 28 Jacob sent Judah ahead to tell Joseph that he was on the way to
Goʹshen. When they came into the land of Goʹshen, 29 Joseph had his chariot
prepared and went up to meet Israel his father at Goʹshen. When he presented
himself to him, he at once embraced him and wept for some time. 30 Then Israel
said to Joseph: “Now I am ready to die; I have seen your face and know that
you are still alive.“ 31 Joseph then said to his brothers and to his
father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Pharʹaoh and tell him,
‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Caʹnaan
have come here to me. 32 The men are shepherds, and they raise livestock, and
they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’ 33
When Pharʹaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ 34 you must
say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock from our youth until now, both we
and our forefathers,’ so that you may dwell in the land of Goʹshen, for
every herder of sheep is detestable to the Egyptians.“ |47| So Joseph went
and reported to Pharʹaoh: “My father and my brothers and their flocks and
their herds and all that they possess have come from the land of Caʹnaan, and
they are in the land of Goʹshen.“ 2 He took five of his brothers and
presented them to Pharʹaoh. 3 Pharʹaoh said to his brothers: “What is your
occupation?“ They replied to Pharʹaoh: “Your servants are herders of
sheep, both we and our forefathers.“ 4 Then they said to Pharʹaoh: “We

                                       49

Genesis 47

have come to reside as foreigners in the land because there are no pastures
for the flock of your servants, for the famine is severe in the land of
Caʹnaan. So please let your servants dwell in the land of Goʹshen.“ 5 At
that Pharʹaoh said to Joseph: “Your father and your brothers have come here
to you. 6 The land of Egypt is at your disposal. Have your father and your
brothers dwell in the very best part of the land. Let them dwell in the land
of Goʹshen, and if you know of any capable men among them, put them in charge
of my livestock.“ 7 Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and presented
him to Pharʹaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharʹaoh. 8 Pharʹaoh asked Jacob: “How
old are you?“ 9 Jacob said to Pharʹaoh: “The years of my wanderings are
130. Few and distressing the years of my life have been, and they are not as
long as the years of the lives of my forefathers during their wanderings.“ 
10 After that Jacob blessed Pharʹaoh and went out from before him. 11 So
Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them a possession in
the land of Egypt, in the very best part of the land, in the land of
Ramʹe·ses, just as Pharʹaoh had commanded. 12 And Joseph kept supplying his
father and his brothers and the entire household of his father with food
according to the number of their children. 13 Now there was no food in all the
land, because the famine was very severe, and the land of Egypt and the land
of Caʹnaan became exhausted as a result of the famine. 14 Joseph was
collecting all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the
land of Caʹnaan for the grain that people were buying, and Joseph kept
bringing the money into Pharʹaoh’s house. 15 In time the money from the
land of Egypt and the land of Caʹnaan was spent, and all the Egyptians began
coming to Joseph, saying: “Give us food! Why should we die before your very
eyes because our money has run out?“ 16 Then Joseph said: “If your money
has run out, hand over your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange
for your livestock.“ 17 So they began bringing their livestock to Joseph,
and Joseph kept giving them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock
of the flock and of the herd, and the donkeys, and he kept providing them with
food in exchange for all their livestock during that year. 18 When that year
came to its close, they began coming to him the next year and saying: “We
will not hide from my lord that the money and the stock of domestic animals
have already been given to my lord. We have nothing left for my lord but our
bodies and our land. 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our
land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we together with our land
will become slaves to Pharʹaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die
and that our land may not become desolate.“ 20 Joseph then bought all the
land of the Egyptians for Pharʹaoh because every Egyptian sold his field, for
the famine was very severe; and the land became Pharʹaoh’s. 21 Then he
moved the people into cities, from one end of the territory of Egypt to its
other end. 22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the rations
for the priests were from Pharʹaoh and they lived on their rations that
Pharʹaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land. 23 Then Joseph
said to the people: “See, I have today bought you and your land for
Pharʹaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land with it. 24 When it
produces, give a fifth to Pharʹaoh, but four parts will be yours as seed for
the field and as food for you and for those in your houses and for your
children to eat.“ 25 So they said: “You have preserved our lives. Let us
find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will become slaves to Pharʹaoh.“ 
26 Then Joseph made it a decree, which is valid until today over the land of
Egypt, that a fifth belongs to Pharʹaoh. It was only the land of the priests

                                       50

Genesis 47

that did not become Pharʹaoh’s. 27 Israel continued to dwell in the land of
Egypt, in the land of Goʹshen, and they settled in it and were fruitful and
increased greatly. 28 And Jacob lived on in the land of Egypt for 17 years, so
that the days of Jacob’s life came to be 147 years. 29 The time was
approaching for Israel to die, so he called his son Joseph and said: “If,
now, I have found favor in your eyes, place your hand, please, under my thigh,
and show loyal love and faithfulness to me. Please, do not bury me in Egypt. 
30 When I die, you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in the grave of my
forefathers.“ Accordingly, he said: “I will do just as you say.“ 31 Then
he said: “Swear to me.“ So he swore to him. At that Israel bowed down at
the head of his bed. |48| After these things, Joseph was told: “Look, your
father is getting weak.“ At that he took his two sons Ma·nasʹseh and
Eʹphra·im with him. 2 Then Jacob was told: “Here your son Joseph has come
to you.“ So Israel gathered his strength and sat up on his bed. 3 And Jacob
said to Joseph:
“God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Caʹnaan
and blessed me. 4 And he said to me, ‘I am making you fruitful, and I will
make you many, and I will transform you into a congregation of peoples, and I
will give this land to your offspring after you as a lasting possession.’ 5
Now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to
you in Egypt are mine. Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh will become mine just as
Reuʹben and Simʹe·on are mine. 6 But the children born to you after them
will become yours. They will be called by the name of their brothers in their
inheritance. 7 As for me, when I was coming from Padʹdan, Rachel died
alongside me in the land of Caʹnaan, while there was yet a good stretch of
land before coming to Ephʹrath. So I buried her there on the way to
Ephʹrath, that is, Bethʹle·hem.“ 8 Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons and
asked: “Who are these?“ 9 So Joseph said to his father: “They are my
sons whom God has given me in this place.“ At this he said: “Bring them to
me, please, so that I may bless them.“ 10 Now the eyes of Israel were
failing from age, and he was unable to see. So Joseph brought them close to
him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 11 Israel said to Joseph: “I
never imagined I would see your face, but here God has also let me see your
offspring.“ 12 Joseph then removed them from Israel’s knees, and he bowed
down with his face to the ground. 13 Joseph now took the two of them,
Eʹphra·im with his right hand to Israel’s left and Ma·nasʹseh with his
left hand to Israel’s right, and brought them close to him. 14 However,
Israel put out his right hand and placed it on Eʹphra·im’s head, although
he was the younger, and he placed his left hand on Ma·nasʹseh’s head. He
purposely laid his hands this way, since Ma·nasʹseh was the firstborn. 15
Then he blessed Joseph and said:
“The true God before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac walked,The true God who has been shepherding me during all
my life until this day, 16 The angel who has been recovering me from all
calamity, bless the boys.
Let my name be called upon them and the name of my
fathers, Abraham and Isaac,Let them increase to a multitude in the earth.“ 
17 When Joseph saw that his father kept his right hand placed on
Eʹphra·im’s head, it was displeasing to him, so he tried to take hold of
his father’s hand to move it from Eʹphra·im’s head to Ma·nasʹseh’s
head. 18 Joseph said to his father: “Not so, my father, because this is the
firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.“ 19 But his father kept refusing
and said: “I know it, my son, I know it. He too will become a people, and he
too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will become greater
than he will, and his offspring will become the full equivalent of nations.“

                                       51

Genesis 48

20 So he continued to bless them on that day, saying:
“Let Israel mention
you when they pronounce blessings, saying,‘May God make you like Eʹphra·im
and like Ma·nasʹseh.’“
Thus he kept putting Eʹphra·im before
Ma·nasʹseh. 21 Then Israel said to Joseph: “Look, I am dying, but God will
certainly continue with you and return you to the land of your forefathers. 22
As for me, I do give you one portion of land more than to your brothers, which
I took from the hand of the Amʹor·ites with my sword and my bow.“ |49| And
Jacob called his sons and said: “Gather yourselves together that I may tell
you what will happen to you in the final part of the days. 2 Assemble
yourselves and listen, you sons of Jacob, yes, listen to Israel your father. 3
“Reuʹben, you are my firstborn, my vigor and the beginning of my
procreative power, the excellence of dignity and the excellence of strength. 4
With recklessness like turbulent waters, you will not excel, because you have
gone up to your father’s bed. At that time you defiled my bed. He actually
went on to it! 5 “Simʹe·on and Leʹvi are brothers. Instruments of
violence are their slaughter weapons. 6 Into their company do not come, O my
soul. With their assembly do not join, O my honor, because in their anger they
killed men, and for their pleasure they hamstrung bulls. 7 Cursed be their
anger, because it is cruel, and their fury, because it is harsh. Let me
disperse them in Jacob, and let me scatter them in Israel. 8 “As for you,
Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your
enemies. The sons of your father will bow down before you. 9 Judah is a lion
cub. From the prey, my son, you will certainly go up. He has crouched down and
stretched himself out like a lion, and like a lion, who dares rouse him? 10
The scepter will not depart from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from
between his feet, until Shiʹloh comes, and to him the obedience of the
peoples will belong. 11 Tying his donkey to a vine and his donkey’s colt to
a choice vine, he will wash his clothing in wine and his garment in the blood
of grapes. 12 Dark red are his eyes from wine, and his teeth are white from
milk. 13 “Zebʹu·lun will reside by the seashore, by the shore where the
ships lie anchored, and his remote border will be toward Siʹdon. 14
“Isʹsa·char is a strong-boned donkey, lying down between the two
saddlebags. 15 And he will see that the resting-place is good and that the
land is pleasant. He will bend his shoulder to bear the burden and will submit
to forced labor. 16 “Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of
Israel. 17 Let Dan be a serpent by the roadside, a horned snake beside the
path, that bites the heels of the horse so that its rider falls backward. 18 I
will wait for salvation from you, O Jehovah. 19 “As for Gad, a marauder band
will raid him, but he will raid at their heels. 20 “Ashʹer’s bread will
be abundant, and he will provide food fit for a king. 21 “Naphʹta·li is a
slender doe. He is speaking words of elegance. 22 “Joseph is the offshoot of
a fruitful tree, a fruitful tree by a spring, whose branches extend over the
wall. 23 But the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring
animosity against him. 24 And yet his bow remained in place, and his hands
stayed strong and agile. This was from the hands of the powerful one of Jacob,
from the shepherd, the stone of Israel. 25 He is from the God of your father,
and he will help you, and he is with the Almighty, and he will bless you with
the blessings of the heavens above, with the blessings of the deep below, with
the blessings of the breasts and womb. 26 The blessings of your father will be
superior to the blessings of the eternal mountains, to the desirable things of
the enduring hills. They will continue upon the head of Joseph, upon the crown
of the head of the one singled out from his brothers. 27 “Benjamin will keep

Genesis 49

on tearing like a wolf. In the morning he will eat the prey, and in the
evening he will divide spoil.“ 28 All of these are the 12 tribes of Israel,
and this is what their father said to them when he was blessing them. He gave
each of them an appropriate blessing. 29 After that he gave these commands to
them: “I am being gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave
that is in the field of Eʹphron the Hitʹtite, 30 the cave in the field of
Mach·peʹlah in front of Mamʹre in the land of Caʹnaan, the field that
Abraham purchased from Eʹphron the Hitʹtite as a property for a burial
place. 31 There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah. There they buried
Isaac and his wife Re·bekʹah, and there I buried Leʹah. 32 The field and
the cave that is in it were purchased from the sons of Heth.“ 33 Thus Jacob
finished giving these instructions to his sons. Then he drew his feet up onto
the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people. |50| Joseph then
threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him. 2 After that
Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father. So the
physicians embalmed Israel, 3 and they took the full 40 days for him, for this
is the full period for the embalming, and the Egyptians continued to shed
tears for him 70 days. 4 When the days of mourning for him passed, Joseph
spoke to Pharʹaoh’s court, saying: “If I have found favor in your eyes,
give this message to Pharʹaoh: 5 ‘My father made me swear, saying: “Look!
I am dying. You are to bury me in my burial place, which I have excavated in
the land of Caʹnaan.“ Please, let me go up and bury my father, after which
I will return.’“ 6 Pharʹaoh replied: “Go and bury your father just as
he made you swear.“ 7 So Joseph went up to bury his father, and all of
Pharʹaoh’s servants went with him, the elders of his court and all the
elders of the land of Egypt 8 and all of Joseph’s household and his brothers
and the household of his father. Only their little children and their flocks
and their herds they left in the land of Goʹshen. 9 Chariots and horsemen
also went up with him, and the camp was very numerous. 10 Then they came to
the threshing floor of Aʹtad, which is in the region of the Jordan, and there
they carried on a very great and bitter mourning, and he kept mourning for his
father seven days. 11 The inhabitants of the land, the Caʹnaan·ites, saw
them mourning at the threshing floor of Aʹtad, and they exclaimed: “This is
a great mourning for the Egyptians!“ That is why it was named
Aʹbel-mizʹra·im, which is in the region of the Jordan. 12 So his sons did
for him exactly as he had instructed them. 13 His sons carried him into the
land of Caʹnaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Mach·peʹlah, the
field in front of Mamʹre that Abraham had purchased from Eʹphron the
Hitʹtite as property for a burial place. 14 After he buried his father,
Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all those who had gone with him
to bury his father. 15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was
dead, they said: “It may be that Joseph is harboring animosity against us
and that he will repay us for all the evil that we did to him.“ 16 So they
sent a message to Joseph in these words: “Your father gave this command
before his death: 17 ‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: “I beg you,
please pardon the transgression of your brothers and the sin they committed in
bringing such harm to you.“’ Now, please, pardon the transgression of the
servants of your father’s God.“ And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18
Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said: “Here we are
as slaves to you!“ 19 Joseph said to them: “Do not be afraid. Am I in the
place of God? 20 Although you meant to harm me, God intended it to turn out
well and to preserve many people alive, as he is doing today. 21 So now do not

                                       53

Genesis 50

be afraid. I will keep supplying you and your little children with food.“
Thus he comforted them and spoke reassuringly to them. 22 And Joseph continued
to dwell in Egypt, he and the household of his father, and Joseph lived for
110 years. 23 Joseph saw the third generation of Eʹphra·im’s sons, also
the sons of Maʹchir, Ma·nasʹseh’s son. They were born upon Joseph’s
knees. 24 At length Joseph said to his brothers: “I am dying, but God will
without fail turn his attention to you, and he will certainly bring you up out
of this land to the land about which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob.“ 25 So Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying: “God will
without fail turn his attention to you. You must take my bones up out of
here.“ 26 And Joseph died at the age of 110, and they had him embalmed, and
he was put in a coffin in Egypt. 


Exodus

|1| Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt with Jacob,
each man who came with his household: 2 Reuʹben, Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, and
Judah; 3 Isʹsa·char, Zebʹu·lun, and Benjamin; 4 Dan and Naphʹta·li; Gad
and Ashʹer. 5 And all those who were born to Jacob were 70 people, but Joseph
was already in Egypt. 6 Joseph eventually died, and also all his brothers and
all that generation. 7 And the Israelites became fruitful and began to
increase greatly, and they kept on multiplying and growing mightier at an
extraordinary rate, so that the land became filled with them. 8 In time there
arose over Egypt a new king, one who did not know Joseph. 9 So he said to his
people: “Look! The people of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we
are. 10 Let us deal shrewdly with them. Otherwise, they will continue to
multiply, and if a war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight
against us and leave the country.“ 11 So they appointed chiefs of forced
labor over them to oppress them with hard labor, and they built storage cities
for Pharʹaoh, namely, Piʹthom and Ra·amʹses. 12 But the more they would
oppress them, the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading
out, so they felt sick with fear because of the Israelites. 13 Consequently,
the Egyptians forced the Israelites into harsh slavery. 14 They made their
life bitter with hard labor, as they worked with clay mortar and bricks and in
every form of slavery in the field. Yes, they made them toil in harsh
conditions in every form of slavery. 15 Later the king of Egypt spoke to the
Hebrew midwives whose names were Shiphʹrah and Puʹah, 16 and he told them:
“When you help the Hebrew women to give birth and you see them on the stool
for childbirth, you must put the child to death if it is a son; but if it is a
daughter, she must live.“ 17 However, the midwives feared the true God, and
they did not do what the king of Egypt told them. Instead, they would keep the
male children alive. 18 In time the king of Egypt called the midwives and said
to them: “Why have you kept the male children alive?“ 19 The midwives said
to Pharʹaoh: “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. They are
lively and have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them.“
20 So God dealt well with the midwives, and the people kept increasing and
becoming very mighty. 21 And because the midwives had feared the true God, he
later gave them families. 22 Finally Pharʹaoh commanded all his people:
“You are to throw every newborn son of the Hebrews into the Nile River, but
you are to keep every daughter alive.“ |2| About that time, a certain man of
the house of Leʹvi married a daughter of Leʹvi. 2 And the woman became
pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw how beautiful he was, she kept
him concealed for three months. 3 When she was no longer able to conceal him,
she took a papyrus basket and coated it with bitumen and pitch and put the
child in it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile River. 4 But
his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. 5 When

                                       54

Exodus 2

Pharʹaoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the Nile, her female attendants
were walking by the side of the Nile. And she caught sight of the basket in
the middle of the reeds. She immediately sent her slave girl to get it. 6 When
she opened it, she saw the child, and the boy was crying. She felt compassion
for him, but she said: “This is one of the children of the Hebrews.“ 7
Then his sister said to Pharʹaoh’s daughter: “Shall I go and call a
nursing woman from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?“ 8 Pharʹaoh’s
daughter said to her: “Go!“ At once the girl went and called the child’s
mother. 9 Pharʹaoh’s daughter then said to her: “Take this child with you
and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.“ So the woman took the child and
nursed him. 10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharʹaoh’s
daughter, and he became a son to her. She named him Moses and said: “It is
because I have drawn him out of the water.“ 11 Now in those days, after
Moses had become an adult, he went out to his brothers to look at the burdens
they were bearing, and he caught sight of an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of
his brothers. 12 So he looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he killed
the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13 But he went out on the following day,
and there were two Hebrew men fighting with each other. So he said to the one
in the wrong: “Why do you strike your companion?“ 14 At this he said:
“Who appointed you as a prince and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill
me just as you killed the Egyptian?“ Moses now was afraid and said:
“Surely the matter has become known!“ 15 Then Pharʹaoh heard about it,
and he attempted to kill Moses; but Moses ran away from Pharʹaoh and went to
dwell in the land of Midʹi·an, and he sat down by a well. 16 Now the priest
of Midʹi·an had seven daughters, and these came to draw water and to fill
the troughs to water their father’s flock. 17 But as usual, the shepherds
came and drove them away. At this Moses got up and helped the women and
watered their flock. 18 When they came home to their father Reuʹel, he
exclaimed: “How is it that you have come home so quickly today?“ 19 They
replied: “A certain Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even drew
water for us and watered the flock.“ 20 He said to his daughters: “But
where is he? Why did you leave the man behind? Call him, so that he may eat
with us.“ 21 After that Moses consented to stay with the man, and he gave
his daughter Zip·poʹrah to Moses in marriage. 22 Later she bore a son, and
he named him Gerʹshom, for he said, “I have become a foreign resident in a
foreign land.“ 23 After a long time, the king of Egypt died, but the
Israelites continued to groan because of the slavery and to cry out in
complaint, and their cry for help because of the slavery kept going up to the
true God. 24 In time God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 25 So God looked on the Israelites; and God
took notice. |3| Moses became a shepherd of the flock of his father-in-law
Jethʹro, the priest of Midʹi·an. While he was leading the flock to the west
side of the wilderness, he eventually came to the mountain of the true God, to
Horʹeb. 2 Then Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the
midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, he saw that the thornbush was on
fire, and yet the thornbush was not consumed. 3 So Moses said: “I will go
over to inspect this unusual sight to see why the thornbush does not burn
up.“ 4 When Jehovah saw that he went over to look, God called to him out of
the thornbush and said: “Moses! Moses!“ to which he said: “Here I am.“
5 Then he said: “Do not come any nearer. Remove your sandals from your feet,
because the place where you are standing is holy ground.“ 6 He went on to
say: “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and

                                       55

Exodus 3

the God of Jacob.“ Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at
the true God. 7 Jehovah added: “I have certainly seen the affliction of my
people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry because of those who
force them to work; I well know the pains they suffer. 8 I will go down to
rescue them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that
land to a land good and spacious, a land flowing with milk and honey, the
territory of the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the
Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites. 9 Now look! The outcry
of the people of Israel has reached me, and I have seen also the harsh way
that the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10 Now come, I will send you to
Pharʹaoh, and you will bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.“ 11
However, Moses said to the true God: “Who am I that I should go to Pharʹaoh
and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?“ 12 To this he said: “I will prove
to be with you, and this is the sign for you that it was I who sent you: After
you have brought the people out of Egypt, you people will serve the true God
on this mountain.“ 13 But Moses said to the true God: “Suppose I go to the
Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your forefathers has sent me to
you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is his name?’ What should I say to
them?“ 14 So God said to Moses: “I Will Become What I Choose to Become.“
And he added: “This is what you are to say to the Israelites, ‘I Will
Become has sent me to you.’“ 15 Then God said once more to Moses:
“This
is what you are to say to the Israelites, ‘Jehovah the God of your
forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has
sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be
remembered from generation to generation. 16 Now go, and gather the elders of
Israel and say to them, ‘Jehovah the God of your forefathers has appeared to
me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and he said: “I have certainly
taken notice of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt. 17 So I say, I
will take you away from affliction at the hands of the Egyptians to the land
of the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Perʹiz·zites,
the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, to a land flowing with milk and
honey.“’ 18 “They will certainly listen to your voice, and you will go,
you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you men should say to
him: ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has communicated with us. So, please,
let us make a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice
to Jehovah our God.’ 19 But I myself well know that the king of Egypt will
not give you permission to go unless a mighty hand compels him. 20 So I will
have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my extraordinary acts
that I will do in it, and after that he will send you out. 21 And I will give
this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and when you go, you will by
no means go empty-handed. 22 Each woman must ask her neighbor and the woman
lodging in her house for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing,
and you will put them on your sons and your daughters; and you will plunder
the Egyptians.“ |4| However, Moses answered: “But suppose they do not
believe me and do not listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘Jehovah did
not appear to you.’“ 2 Then Jehovah said to him: “What is that in your
hand?“ He answered: “A rod.“ 3 He said: “Throw it on the ground.“ So
he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. 4
Jehovah now said to Moses: “Reach out your hand and seize it by the tail.“
So he reached out and seized it, and it became a rod in his hand. 5 God then
said: “This is so that they may believe that Jehovah the God of their
forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has

                                       56

Exodus 4

appeared to you.“ 6 Jehovah said to him once more: “Put your hand, please,
into the upper fold of your garment.“ So he put his hand into the fold of
his garment. When he drew it out, why, his hand was stricken with leprosy like
snow! 7 Then he said: “Return your hand into the upper fold of your
garment.“ So he returned his hand into his garment. When he drew it out of
the garment, it was restored like the rest of his flesh! 8 He said: “If they
will not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, then they will
certainly heed the next sign. 9 Still, even if they will not believe these two
signs and refuse to listen to your voice, you will take some water from the
Nile River and pour it out on the dry land, and the water that you take from
the Nile will become blood on the dry land.“ 10 Moses now said to Jehovah:
“Pardon me, Jehovah, but I have never been a fluent speaker, neither in the
past nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech and
slow of tongue.“ 11 Jehovah said to him: “Who made a mouth for man, or who
makes them speechless, deaf, clear-sighted, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah? 12
So go now, and I will be with you as you speak, and I will teach you what you
should say.“ 13 But he said: “Pardon me, Jehovah, please send anyone whom
you want to send.“ 14 Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against Moses, and he
said: “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak
very well. And he is now on his way here to meet you. When he sees you, his
heart will rejoice. 15 So you must speak to him and put the words in his
mouth, and I will be with you and him as you speak, and I will teach you men
what to do. 16 He will speak for you to the people, and he will be your
spokesman, and you will serve as God to him. 17 And you will take this rod in
your hand and perform the signs with it.“ 18 So Moses went back to Jethʹro
his father-in-law and said to him: “I want to go, please, and return to my
brothers who are in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.“ Jethʹro
said to Moses: “Go in peace.“ 19 After that Jehovah said to Moses in
Midʹi·an: “Go, return to Egypt, because all the men who were seeking to
kill you are dead.“ 20 Then Moses took his wife and his sons and lifted them
onto a donkey, and he started back to the land of Egypt. Moreover, Moses took
the rod of the true God in his hand. 21 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “After
you have returned to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharʹaoh all the
miracles that I have empowered you to do. But I will allow his heart to become
obstinate, and he will not send the people away. 22 You must say to Pharʹaoh,
‘This is what Jehovah says: “Israel is my son, my firstborn. 23 I say to
you, Send my son away so that he may serve me. But if you refuse to send him
away, I am going to kill your son, your firstborn.“’“ 24 Now on the road
at the lodging place, Jehovah met him and was seeking to put him to death. 25
Finally Zip·poʹrah took a flint and circumcised her son and caused his
foreskin to touch his feet and said: “It is because you are a bridegroom of
blood to me.“ 26 So He let him go. At that time she said, “a bridegroom of
blood,“ because of the circumcision. 27 Then Jehovah said to Aaron: “Go
into the wilderness to meet Moses.“ So he went and met him at the mountain
of the true God and greeted him with a kiss. 28 And Moses told Aaron all the
words of Jehovah, who had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded
him to do. 29 After that Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of
the Israelites. 30 Aaron told them all the words that Jehovah had spoken to
Moses, and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people. 31 At this
the people believed. When they heard that Jehovah had turned his attention to
the Israelites and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed down and
prostrated themselves. |5| Afterward, Moses and Aaron went in and said to

                                       57

Exodus 5

Pharʹaoh: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Send my people
away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.’“ 2
But Pharʹaoh said: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to send
Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all, and what is more, I will not send
Israel away.“ 3 But they said: “The God of the Hebrews has communicated
with us. Please, we want to make a three-day journey into the wilderness and
sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise, he will strike us with disease or
with the sword.“ 4 The king of Egypt replied to them: “Why is it, Moses
and Aaron, that you are taking the people away from their work? Return to your
labor!“ 5 And Pharʹaoh continued: “Look at how many people of the land
there are, and you would have them rest from their labor.“ 6 That same day,
Pharʹaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foremen: 7 “You must no longer
give straw to the people to make bricks. Let them go and gather straw for
themselves. 8 But you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as
they made in the past. Do not reduce it for them, for they are relaxing. That
is why they are crying out, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to our
God!’ 9 Make them work harder, and keep them busy so that they will not pay
attention to lies.“ 10 So the taskmasters and their foremen went out and
said to the people: “Here is what Pharʹaoh has said, ‘I am giving you no
more straw. 11 Go and get your own straw for yourselves wherever you can find
it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’“ 12 Then the people
scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 13 And
the taskmasters kept urging them: “You must each finish your work every day,
just as when straw was provided.“ 14 Also the foremen of the Israelites,
whom Pharʹaoh’s taskmasters had appointed over them, were beaten. They
asked them: “Why did you not reach the quota of bricks that you used to
make? It happened both yesterday and today.“ 15 So the foremen of the
Israelites went in and complained to Pharʹaoh: “Why are you treating your
servants this way? 16 No straw is given to your servants, yet they are saying
to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are beaten, but your own people are at
fault.“ 17 But he said: “You are relaxing, you are relaxing! That is why
you are saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.’ 18 So
now go, get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you must still
produce your quota of bricks.“ 19 Then the foremen of the Israelites saw
that they were in serious trouble because of the order: “You must not reduce
your daily quota of bricks at all.“ 20 After that they met up with Moses and
Aaron, who were standing there to meet them as they came out from Pharʹaoh. 
21 At once they said to them: “May Jehovah look upon you and judge, since
you have made Pharʹaoh and his servants despise us and you have put a sword
in their hand to kill us.“ 22 Then Moses turned to Jehovah and said:
“Jehovah, why have you afflicted this people? Why have you sent me? 23 From
the time that I went in before Pharʹaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt
worse with this people, and you have certainly not rescued your people.“ |6|
So Jehovah said to Moses: “Now you will see what I will do to Pharʹaoh. A
mighty hand will force him to send them away, and a mighty hand will force him
to drive them out of his land.“ 2 Then God said to Moses: “I am Jehovah. 3
And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but with
regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them. 4 I also
established my covenant with them to give them the land of Caʹnaan, the land
in which they lived as foreigners. 5 Now I myself have heard the groaning of
the people of Israel, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I remember my
covenant. 6 “Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am Jehovah, and I will

                                       58

Exodus 6

bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from
their slavery, and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great
judgments. 7 And I will take you in as my people, and I will be your God, and
you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out
from under the burdens of Egypt. 8 And I will bring you into the land that I
swore with an oath to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to
you as something to possess. I am Jehovah.’“ 9 Moses later gave this
message to the Israelites, but they did not listen to Moses because of their
discouragement and because of the harsh slavery. 10 Then Jehovah spoke to
Moses, saying: 11 “Go in and tell Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, that he should
send the Israelites away out of his land.“ 12 However, Moses replied to
Jehovah: “Look! The Israelites have not listened to me; how will Pharʹaoh
ever listen to me, as I speak with difficulty?“ 13 But Jehovah again told
Moses and Aaron what commands to give to the Israelites and to Pharʹaoh,
Egypt’s king, in order to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt. 14
These are the heads of the house of their fathers: The sons of Reuʹben,
Israel’s firstborn, were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and Carʹmi. These are
the families of Reuʹben. 15 The sons of Simʹe·on were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin,
Oʹhad, Jaʹchin, Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul, the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman.
These are the families of Simʹe·on. 16 These are the names of the sons of
Leʹvi, according to their family descents: Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and
Me·rarʹi. The length of Leʹvi’s life was 137 years. 17 The sons of
Gerʹshon were Libʹni and Shimʹe·i, according to their families. 18 The
sons of Koʹhath were Amʹram, Izʹhar, Hebʹron, and Uzʹzi·el. The length
of Koʹhath’s life was 133 years. 19 The sons of Me·rarʹi were Mahʹli and
Muʹshi.
These were the families of the Levites, according to their family
descents. 20 Now Amʹram took Jochʹe·bed, his father’s sister, as his
wife. She bore him Aaron and Moses. The length of Amʹram’s life was 137
years. 21 The sons of Izʹhar were Korʹah, Neʹpheg, and Zichʹri. 22 The
sons of Uzʹzi·el were Mishʹa·el, El·zaʹphan, and Sithʹri. 23 Now Aaron
took E·liʹshe·ba, Am·minʹa·dab’s daughter, the sister of Nahʹshon, as
his wife. She bore him Naʹdab, A·biʹhu, El·e·aʹzar, and Ithʹa·mar. 24
The sons of Korʹah were Asʹsir, El·kaʹnah, and A·biʹa·saph. These were
the families of the Korʹah·ites. 25 El·e·aʹzar, Aaron’s son, took one
of the daughters of Puʹti·el as his wife. She bore him Phinʹe·has.
These
are the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites, according to their
families. 26 This is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said: “Bring the
people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, company by company.“ 27 It was
they who spoke to Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, to bring the people of Israel out
of Egypt. It was this Moses and Aaron. 28 On that day when Jehovah spoke to
Moses in the land of Egypt, 29 Jehovah told Moses: “I am Jehovah. Speak to
Pharʹaoh, king of Egypt, everything I am speaking to you.“ 30 Then Moses
said before Jehovah: “Look! I speak with difficulty, so how will Pharʹaoh
ever listen to me?“ |7| Jehovah then said to Moses: “See, I have made you
like God to Pharʹaoh, and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet. 2
You are to repeat everything that I will command you, and Aaron your brother
will speak to Pharʹaoh, and he will send the Israelites away from his land. 3
As for me, I will allow Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and I will
multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt. 4 But Pharʹaoh will
not listen to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my multitudes,
my people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments. 5
And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my

                                       59

Exodus 7

hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.“ 6 Moses
and Aaron did what Jehovah had commanded them; they did just so. 7 Moses was
80 years old and Aaron was 83 years old when they spoke to Pharʹaoh. 8
Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron: 9 “If Pharʹaoh says to you, ‘Perform
a miracle,’ then tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod and throw it down before
Pharʹaoh.’ It will become a big snake.“ 10 So Moses and Aaron went in to
Pharʹaoh and did exactly as Jehovah had commanded. Aaron threw his rod down
before Pharʹaoh and his servants, and it became a big snake. 11 However,
Pharʹaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and the magic-practicing
priests of Egypt also did the same thing with their magic. 12 Each one threw
down his rod, and they became big snakes; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their
rods. 13 Still, Pharʹaoh’s heart became obstinate, and he did not listen to
them, just as Jehovah had said. 14 Then Jehovah said to Moses:
“Pharʹaoh’s heart is unresponsive. He has refused to send the people
away. 15 Go to Pharʹaoh in the morning. Look! He is going out to the water!
And you should station yourself to meet him by the edge of the Nile River; and
take with you in your hand the rod that turned into a serpent. 16 And you must
say to him, ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, and he says:
“Send my people away so that they may serve me in the wilderness,“ but you
have not obeyed until now. 17 This is what Jehovah says: “By this you will
know that I am Jehovah. Here I am striking the water that is in the Nile River
with the rod that is in my hand, and it will turn into blood. 18 And the fish
that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will
find it impossible to drink water from the Nile.“’“ 19 Then Jehovah said
to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the
waters of Egypt, over its rivers, over its canals, over its marshes, and over
all its reservoirs, that they may become blood.’ There will be blood in all
the land of Egypt, even in the wooden and stone containers.“ 20 Immediately
Moses and Aaron did just as Jehovah had commanded. He lifted up the rod and
struck the water that was in the Nile River before the eyes of Pharʹaoh and
his servants, and all the water that was in the river was turned into blood. 
21 And the fish that were in the river died, and the river began to stink, and
the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the Nile, and there was blood
throughout the land of Egypt. 22 Nevertheless, the magic-practicing priests of
Egypt did the same thing with their secret arts, so that Pharʹaoh’s heart
continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had
said. 23 Then Pharʹaoh returned to his house, and he did not take this to
heart either. 24 So all the Egyptians were digging all around the Nile for
water to drink, because they could not drink any water of the Nile. 25 And
seven full days passed after Jehovah struck the Nile. |8| Then Jehovah said to
Moses: “Go in to Pharʹaoh and say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah says:
“Send my people away so that they may serve me. 2 If you keep refusing to
send them away, I will plague all your territory with frogs. 3 And the Nile
River will swarm with frogs, and they will come up and enter into your house,
into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants and on your
people, into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs. 4 On you, on your
people, and on all your servants, the frogs will come up.“’“ 5 Jehovah
later said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod
over the rivers, the Nile canals, and the marshes, and make the frogs come up
over the land of Egypt.’“ 6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the
waters of Egypt, and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of
Egypt. 7 However, the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their

                                       60

Exodus 8

secret arts, and they too made the frogs come up over the land of Egypt. 8
Pharʹaoh then called Moses and Aaron and said: “Plead with Jehovah to
remove the frogs from me and my people, as I want to send the people away so
that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.“ 9 Then Moses said to Pharʹaoh: “I
leave to you the honor of telling me when I should plead to have the frogs
removed from you, your servants, your people, and your houses. Only in the
Nile River will they be left.“ 10 To this he said: “Tomorrow.“ So he
said: “It will be according to your word so that you may know that there is
no one else like Jehovah our God. 11 The frogs will depart from you, your
houses, your servants, and your people. They will be left only in the Nile.“
12 So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharʹaoh, and Moses pleaded with Jehovah
about the frogs that He had brought upon Pharʹaoh. 13 Then Jehovah did as
Moses asked, and the frogs began to die in the houses, the courtyards, and the
fields. 14 They were piling them up in countless heaps, and the land began to
stink. 15 When Pharʹaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and
he refused to listen to them, just as Jehovah had said. 16 Jehovah now said to
Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the
earth, and it must become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’“ 17 And they
did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the
earth, and the gnats came on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became
gnats in all the land of Egypt. 18 The magic-practicing priests tried to do
the same and produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. And the
gnats came on man and beast. 19 So the magic-practicing priests said to
Pharʹaoh: “It is the finger of God!“ But Pharʹaoh’s heart continued to
be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said. 20 Then
Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and station yourself in
front of Pharʹaoh. Look! He is coming out to the water! And you must say to
him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Send my people away so that they may
serve me. 21 But if you do not send my people away, I will send on you, your
servants, and your people and into your houses the gadfly; and the houses of
Egypt will be full of gadflies, and they will even cover the ground they stand
on. 22 On that day I will certainly set apart the land of Goʹshen, where my
people are dwelling. No gadflies will exist there, and by this you will know
that I, Jehovah, am here in the land. 23 And I will make a distinction between
my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will take place.“’“ 24 And
Jehovah did so, and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of
Pharʹaoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of Egypt. The land
was ruined by the gadflies. 25 Finally, Pharʹaoh called Moses and Aaron and
said: “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.“ 26 But Moses said: “It is
not proper to do so, because what we would sacrifice to Jehovah our God would
be detestable to the Egyptians. If we would make a sacrifice that was
detestable to the Egyptians right before their eyes, would they not stone us? 
27 We will make a three-day journey into the wilderness, and there we will
sacrifice to Jehovah our God, just as he has said to us.“ 28 Pharʹaoh now
said: “I will send you away to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the
wilderness. Only, you must not go so far away. Plead in my behalf.“ 29 Then
Moses said: “Now I am going away from you, and I will plead with Jehovah,
and the gadflies will depart from Pharʹaoh, his servants, and his people
tomorrow. But Pharʹaoh must stop trifling with us by refusing to send the
people away to sacrifice to Jehovah.“ 30 Moses then went out from Pharʹaoh
and pleaded with Jehovah. 31 So Jehovah did according to Moses’ word, and
the gadflies departed from Pharʹaoh, his servants, and his people. Not one

                                       61

Exodus 8

was left. 32 However, Pharʹaoh again hardened his heart and did not send the
people away. |9| So Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Pharʹaoh and say to
him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my
people away so that they may serve me. 2 But if you refuse to send them away
and you keep holding them, 3 look! Jehovah’s hand will come against your
livestock in the field. On the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herd, and
the flock, there will be a devastating plague. 4 And Jehovah will certainly
make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt,
and nothing that belongs to the Israelites will die.“’“ 5 Moreover,
Jehovah set an appointed time, saying: “Tomorrow Jehovah will do this in the
land.“ 6 And Jehovah did this on the very next day, and all sorts of
livestock of Egypt began to die, but not one of Israel’s livestock died. 7
When Pharʹaoh inquired, look! not so much as one of Israel’s livestock had
died. Nevertheless, Pharʹaoh’s heart continued to be unresponsive, and he
did not send the people away. 8 Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron: “Fill
both of your hands with soot from a kiln, and Moses must throw it into the air
in front of Pharʹaoh. 9 And it will become a fine dust on all the land of
Egypt, and it will become festering boils on man and beast in all the land of
Egypt.“ 10 So they took soot from a kiln and stood before Pharʹaoh, and
Moses tossed it into the air, and it became festering boils breaking out on
man and beast. 11 The magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before
Moses because of the boils, for they had developed on the magic-practicing
priests and on all the Egyptians. 12 But Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart
to become obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had told
Moses. 13 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and
station yourself in front of Pharʹaoh, and say to him, ‘This is what
Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away so that they
may serve me. 14 For now I am directing all my blows to strike your heart,
your servants, and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like
me in all the earth. 15 For by now I could have thrust my hand out to strike
you and your people with a devastating plague, and you would have been wiped
out from the earth. 16 But for this very reason I have kept you in existence:
to show you my power and to have my name declared in all the earth. 17 Are you
still behaving arrogantly against my people by not sending them away? 18 Here
I will cause a very great hail to rain down tomorrow about this time, such as
has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 19
Therefore, send word to bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the
field under shelter. Every man and beast caught in the field and not brought
into the house will die when the hail comes down on them.“’“ 20 Anyone
among Pharʹaoh’s servants who feared Jehovah’s word quickly brought his
own servants and his livestock into the houses, 21 but whoever did not take
Jehovah’s word to heart left his servants and his livestock in the field. 22
Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, so
that hail may come down on all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and all the
vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.“ 23 So Moses stretched out his
rod toward the heavens, and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire fell down
to the earth, and Jehovah kept making it rain down hail on the land of Egypt. 
24 There was hail, and there was fire flashing in the midst of the hail. It
was very heavy; there had never been any like it in the land since Egypt had
become a nation. 25 The hail struck everything in the field throughout the
land of Egypt, from man to beast, and it struck down all the vegetation and
shattered all the trees of the field. 26 Only in the land of Goʹshen, where

                                       62

Exodus 9

the Israelites were, there was no hail. 27 So Pharʹaoh sent for Moses and
Aaron and said to them: “I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and
I and my people are in the wrong. 28 Plead with Jehovah that there may be an
end to God’s thunder and hail. Then I will be willing to send you away, and
you will not stay any longer.“ 29 So Moses said to him: “As soon as I go
out of the city, I will spread out my hands before Jehovah. The thunder will
stop and the hail will not continue any longer, so that you may know that the
earth belongs to Jehovah. 30 But as for you and your servants, I know already
that even then, you will not fear Jehovah God.“ 31 Now the flax and the
barley had been struck down, because the barley was in the ear and the flax
had flower buds. 32 But the wheat and the spelt had not been struck down,
because they were later crops. 33 Moses now went out of the city from
Pharʹaoh and spread out his hands before Jehovah, and the thunder and the
hail stopped and the rain quit pouring down on the earth. 34 When Pharʹaoh
saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had stopped, he sinned again and
hardened his heart, he as well as his servants. 35 And Pharʹaoh’s heart
continued obstinate, and he did not send the Israelites away, just as Jehovah
had stated through Moses. |10| Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to
Pharʹaoh, for I have allowed his heart and the hearts of his servants to
become unresponsive, so that I may display these signs of mine right before
him, 2 and in order that you may declare to your sons and your grandsons how
severely I have dealt with Egypt and what signs I have performed among them;
and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.“ 3 So Moses and Aaron went in
to Pharʹaoh and said to him: “This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews
has said, ‘How long will you refuse to submit to me? Send my people away so
that they may serve me. 4 For if you keep refusing to send my people away,
here I am bringing locusts within your boundaries tomorrow. 5 And they will
cover the surface of the earth, and it will not be possible to see the ground.
They will eat up what escaped the hail and was left for you, and they will eat
all your trees that are growing in the field. 6 They will fill your houses,
the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all Egypt to an extent that
your fathers and your grandfathers never saw from the time they have been in
this land until today.’“ With that he turned and went out from Pharʹaoh. 
7 Then Pharʹaoh’s servants said to him: “How long will this man continue
to menace us? Send the men away so that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do
you not yet realize that Egypt has been ruined?“ 8 So Moses and Aaron were
brought back to Pharʹaoh, and he said to them: “Go, serve Jehovah your God.
But just who will be going?“ 9 Then Moses said: “We will go with our young
people, our old people, our sons, our daughters, our sheep, and our cattle,
because we will hold a festival to Jehovah.“ 10 He said to them: “If I
ever send you and your children away, then Jehovah is indeed with you! It is
clear that you intend to do something evil. 11 No! Only your men may go and
serve Jehovah, for that is what you requested.“ With that they were driven
out from before Pharʹaoh. 12 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch out your
hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come up over the
land of Egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land, everything that the
hail has let remain.“ 13 At once Moses stretched out his rod over the land
of Egypt, and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow on the land all that day and
all night. The morning came, and the east wind brought the locusts. 14 And the
locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down on the whole
territory of Egypt. It was extremely severe; never before had there been so
many locusts, nor would there ever be so many again. 15 They covered the

Exodus 10

surface of the entire land, and the land grew dark with them; they devoured
all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail
had left; nothing green was left on the trees or on the vegetation of the
field in all the land of Egypt. 16 So Pharʹaoh quickly called Moses and Aaron
and said: “I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you. 17 Now,
please, pardon my sin just this once, and plead with Jehovah your God that he
just remove this deadly plague from upon me.“ 18 So he went out from
Pharʹaoh and pleaded with Jehovah. 19 Then Jehovah caused the wind to shift,
and it became a very stiff west wind, and it carried the locusts away and
drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust remained in all the territory
of Egypt. 20 However, Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate,
and he did not send the Israelites away. 21 Jehovah then said to Moses:
“Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over
the land of Egypt, a darkness so thick that it can be felt.“ 22 Moses
immediately stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was a dense
darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 23 They did not see one
another, and none of them got up from where they were for three days; but all
the Israelites had light in their dwellings. 24 Pharʹaoh then called Moses
and said: “Go, serve Jehovah. Only your sheep and your cattle will remain
behind. Even your children may go with you.“ 25 But Moses said: “You
yourself will also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings, and we will
offer them to Jehovah our God. 26 Our livestock will also go with us. Not an
animal will be allowed to remain, because we will be using some of them to
worship Jehovah our God, and we do not know what we will offer in worship to
Jehovah until we arrive there.“ 27 So Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to
become obstinate, and he did not consent to send them away. 28 Pharʹaoh said
to him: “Get out of my sight! Make sure that you do not try to see my face
again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.“ 29 To this Moses said:
“Just as you have spoken, I will not try to see your face again.“ |11|
Then Jehovah said to Moses: “One more plague I am going to bring upon
Pharʹaoh and Egypt. After that he will send you away from here. When he does
send you away, he will literally drive you out of here. 2 Now tell the people
that all the men and women should ask their neighbor for articles of silver
and of gold.“ 3 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the
Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself had become highly esteemed in the land of
Egypt among Pharʹaoh’s servants and among the people. 4 Moses then said:
“This is what Jehovah has said, ‘About midnight I am going out into the
midst of Egypt, 5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the
firstborn of Pharʹaoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the
slave girl who is working at the hand mill, and every firstborn of the
livestock. 6 Throughout all the land of Egypt, there will be a great outcry
such as has never occurred nor will ever occur again. 7 But not even a dog
will bark at the Israelites, at the men or their livestock, so that you may
know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the
Israelites.’ 8 And all your servants will certainly come down to me and
prostrate themselves to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow
you.’ And after that I will go out.“ With that he went out from Pharʹaoh
in the heat of anger. 9 Jehovah then said to Moses: “Pharʹaoh will not
listen to you, in order for my miracles to be multiplied in the land of
Egypt.“ 10 Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Pharʹaoh,
but Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, so that he did
not send the Israelites away from his land. |12| Jehovah now said to Moses and

                                       64

Exodus 12

Aaron in the land of Egypt: 2 “This month will be the beginning of the
months for you. It will be the first of the months of the year for you. 3
Speak to the entire assembly of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this
month, they should each take for themselves a sheep for their father’s
house, a sheep to a house. 4 But if the household is too small for the sheep,
they and their nearest neighbor should share it between themselves in their
house according to the number of people. When making the calculation,
determine how much of the sheep each one will eat. 5 Your sheep should be a
sound, one-year-old male. You may choose from the young rams or from the
goats. 6 You must care for it until the 14th day of this month, and the whole
congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it at twilight. 7 They
must take some of the blood and splash it on the two doorposts and the upper
part of the doorway of the houses in which they eat it. 8 “‘They must eat
the meat on this night. They should roast it over the fire and eat it along
with unleavened bread and bitter greens. 9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled,
cooked in water, but roast it over the fire, its head together with its shanks
and its inner parts. 10 You must not save any of it until morning, but any of
it left over until morning you should burn with fire. 11 And this is how you
should eat it, with your belt fastened, sandals on your feet, and your staff
in your hand; and you should eat it in a hurry. It is Jehovah’s Passover. 12
For I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every
firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgment
on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah. 13 The blood will serve as your sign
on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass over you, and
the plague will not come on you to destroy you when I strike the land of
Egypt. 14 “‘This day will serve as a memorial for you, and you must
celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations. As a
lasting statute, you should celebrate it. 15 Seven days you are to eat
unleavened bread. Yes, on the first day you are to remove the sourdough from
your houses, because anyone eating what is leavened from the first day down to
the seventh, that person must be cut off from Israel. 16 On the first day you
will hold a holy convention, and on the seventh day, another holy convention.
No work is to be done on these days. Only what every person needs to eat, that
alone may be prepared for you. 17 “‘You must keep the Festival of
Unleavened Bread, for on this very day, I will bring your multitudes out of
the land of Egypt. And you must keep this day throughout your generations as a
lasting statute. 18 In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, in the
evening, you are to eat unleavened bread until the 21st day of the month, in
the evening. 19 No sourdough is to be found in your houses for seven days,
because if anyone eats what is leavened, whether he is a foreigner or a native
of the land, that person must be cut off from the assembly of Israel. 20 You
should not eat anything leavened. In all your homes, you are to eat unleavened
bread.’“ 21 Moses promptly called all the elders of Israel and said to
them: “Go and select young animals for each of your families, and slaughter
the Passover sacrifice. 22 Then you must dip a bunch of hyssop into the blood
that is in a basin and strike the upper part of the doorway and the two
doorposts with the blood; and none of you should go out of the entrance of his
house until morning. 23 Then when Jehovah passes through to plague the
Egyptians and sees the blood on the upper part of the doorway and on the two
doorposts, Jehovah will certainly pass over the entrance, and he will not
allow the plague of death to enter into your houses. 24 “You must observe
this event as a lasting regulation for you and your sons. 25 And when you come

                                       65

---

Exodus 12

into the land that Jehovah will give you just as he has stated, you must keep
this observance. 26 And when your sons ask you, ‘What does this observance
mean to you?’ 27 you must say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the Passover to
Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he plagued
the Egyptians, but he spared our houses.’“
Then the people bowed low and
prostrated themselves. 28 So the Israelites went and did just as Jehovah had
commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so. 29 Then at midnight, Jehovah
struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of
Pharʹaoh who was sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who
was in the prison, and every firstborn of the animals. 30 Pharʹaoh got up
that night along with all his servants and all the other Egyptians, and there
was a great outcry among the Egyptians, because there was not a house where
someone was not dead. 31 At once he called Moses and Aaron by night and said:
“Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the other Israelites. Go
and serve Jehovah, just as you have said. 32 Take also your flocks and your
herds and go, just as you have said. But you must also bless me.“ 33 And the
Egyptians began to urge the people to depart quickly out of the land
“because,“ as they said, “we are all as good as dead!“ 34 So the
people carried their flour dough before it was leavened, with their kneading
troughs wrapped up in their clothing on their shoulder. 35 The Israelites did
what Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and of
gold as well as clothing. 36 Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the
Egyptians, so that they gave them what they asked for, and they plundered the
Egyptians. 37 Then the Israelites departed from Ramʹe·ses for Sucʹcoth,
about 600,000 men on foot, besides children. 38 And a vast mixed company also
went with them, as well as flocks and herds, a great number of livestock. 39
They began to bake the dough that they brought from Egypt into round loaves of
unleavened bread. It was not leavened, because they had been driven out of
Egypt so suddenly that they had not prepared any provisions for themselves. 40
The dwelling of the Israelites, who had dwelled in Egypt, was 430 years. 41 At
the end of the 430 years, on this very day, all the multitudes of Jehovah went
out of the land of Egypt. 42 It is a night on which they will celebrate
Jehovah’s bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This night is to be
observed to Jehovah by all the people of Israel throughout their generations. 
43 Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the
Passover: No foreigner may eat of it. 44 But if someone has a slave man who
was purchased with money, you should circumcise him. Only then may he share in
eating it. 45 A settler and a hired worker may not eat of it. 46 In one house
it is to be eaten. You must not take any of the meat outside of the house, and
you must not break any of its bones. 47 All the assembly of Israel are to
celebrate it. 48 If a foreigner resides with you and he wants to celebrate the
Passover to Jehovah, every male of his must be circumcised. Then he may come
near to celebrate it, and he will become like a native of the land. But no
uncircumcised man may eat of it. 49 One law will apply for the native and for
the foreigner who is residing among you.“ 50 So all the Israelites did just
as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so. 51 On this very
day, Jehovah brought the Israelites along with their multitudes out of the
land of Egypt. |13| Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 “Sanctify to
me every firstborn male among the Israelites. The first male to be born, of
both human and animal, belongs to me.“ 3 Then Moses said to the people:
“Remember this day on which you went out of Egypt, from the house of
slavery, because with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of here. So

                                       66

Exodus 13

nothing leavened may be eaten. 4 You are going out on this day, in the month
of Aʹbib. 5 When Jehovah has brought you into the land of the Caʹnaan·ites,
the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, which
he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
then you must keep this observance in this month. 6 Seven days you are to eat
unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, there will be a festival to Jehovah.
7 Unleavened bread is to be eaten for the seven days; and nothing leavened is
to be found with you, and no sourdough is to be found with you within all your
territory. 8 And you must tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what
Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 9 And this will serve for you
as a sign on your hand and as a memorial on your forehead, so that Jehovah’s
law may be in your mouth, for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of
Egypt. 10 You must keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year. 
11 “When Jehovah brings you into the land of the Caʹnaan·ites, which he
has sworn to you and to your forefathers to give to you, 12 you must devote to
Jehovah every firstborn male, as well as every male firstling of the livestock
that you acquire. The males belong to Jehovah. 13 Every firstling donkey you
are to redeem with a sheep, and if you do not redeem it, then you must break
its neck. And every firstborn male of your sons you are to redeem. 14 “In
case your son should ask you later on, ‘What does this mean?’ then you
should say to him, ‘With a mighty hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from
the house of slavery. 15 When Pharʹaoh stubbornly refused to send us away,
Jehovah killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man
to the firstborn of beast. That is why I am sacrificing to Jehovah all the
firstborn males, and I redeem every firstborn of my sons.’ 16 This must
serve as a sign on your hand and as a headband on your forehead, for with a
mighty hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.“ 17 Now when Pharʹaoh sent the
people away, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the
Phi·lisʹtines, although it was near. For God said: “The people may change
their minds when they are confronted by war and will return to Egypt.“ 18 So
God made the people go around by the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. But
it was in battle formation that the Israelites went up out of the land of
Egypt. 19 Moses also took Joseph’s bones with him, because Joseph had made
the sons of Israel solemnly swear: “God will not fail to turn his attention
to you, and you must take my bones up out of here with you.“ 20 They
departed from Sucʹcoth and encamped at Eʹtham, at the edge of the
wilderness. 21 Now Jehovah was going ahead of them by day in a pillar of cloud
to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them
light, so that they could travel by day and by night. 22 The pillar of cloud
would not move away from before the people during the day, nor the pillar of
fire at night. |14| Jehovah now said to Moses: 2 “Tell the Israelites that
they should turn back and encamp before Pi·ha·hiʹroth, between Migʹdol and
the sea, within view of Baʹal-zeʹphon. You are to encamp facing it by the
sea. 3 Then Pharʹaoh will say about the Israelites, ‘They are wandering in
confusion in the land. The wilderness has closed in on them.’ 4 I will allow
Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and he will chase after them, and I
will glorify myself by means of Pharʹaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians
will certainly know that I am Jehovah.“ So that is what they did. 5 Later it
was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had run away. Immediately,
Pharʹaoh and his servants had a change of heart regarding the people, and
they said: “Why did we do this and release Israel from serving as slaves for
us?“ 6 So he made his war chariots ready, and he took his people with him. 7

                                       67

Exodus 14

He took 600 chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with warriors
on every one of them. 8 Thus Jehovah allowed the heart of Pharʹaoh king of
Egypt to become obstinate, and he chased after the Israelites, while the
Israelites were going out with confidence. 9 The Egyptians chased after them,
and all the chariot horses of Pharʹaoh and his cavalrymen and his army were
catching up with them while they were camping by the sea, by Pi·ha·hiʹroth,
facing Baʹal-zeʹphon. 10 When Pharʹaoh got closer, the Israelites raised
their eyes and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. The Israelites became
terrified and began to cry out to Jehovah. 11 They said to Moses: “Is it
because there are no burial places in Egypt that you have brought us here to
die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by leading us out of Egypt? 12
Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt when we said, ‘Let us alone,
so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it is better for us to serve the
Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.“ 13 Then Moses said to the people:
“Do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah that he will
perform for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you will never
ever see again. 14 Jehovah himself will fight for you, and you will keep
silent.“ 15 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Why do you keep crying out to me?
Tell the Israelites that they should break camp. 16 As for you, lift up your
rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the
Israelites may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground. 17 As for me, I
am allowing the hearts of the Egyptians to become obstinate, so that they will
go in after them; thus I will glorify myself by means of Pharʹaoh and all his
army, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen. 18 And the Egyptians will
certainly know that I am Jehovah when I glorify myself by means of Pharʹaoh,
his war chariots, and his cavalrymen.“ 19 Then the angel of the true God who
was going ahead of the camp of Israel departed and went to their rear, and the
pillar of cloud that was in front of them moved to the rear and stood behind
them. 20 So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel.
On the one side, it was a dark cloud. On the other side, it was lighting up
the night. So the one camp did not come near the other camp all night long. 21
Moses now stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah drove the sea back
with a strong east wind all night long, turning the sea basin into dry ground,
and the waters divided. 22 So the Israelites went through the midst of the sea
on dry ground, while the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their
left. 23 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharʹaoh’s horses, his war
chariots, and his cavalrymen began going after them into the midst of the sea.
24 During the morning watch, Jehovah looked at the camp of the Egyptians from
within the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the camp of the Egyptians
into confusion. 25 He kept taking wheels off their chariots so that they were
driving them with difficulty, and the Egyptians were saying: “Let us flee
from any contact with Israel, because Jehovah is fighting for them against the
Egyptians.“ 26 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand over the
sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, their war chariots,
and their cavalrymen.“ 27 Moses at once stretched out his hand over the sea,
and as morning approached, the sea returned to its normal condition. As the
Egyptians fled from it, Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the
sea. 28 The returning waters covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen and
all of Pharʹaoh’s army who had gone into the sea after them. Not so much as
one among them was allowed to survive. 29 But the Israelites walked on dry
ground in the midst of the seabed, and the waters formed a wall on their right
hand and on their left. 30 Thus Jehovah saved Israel on that day from the hand

                                       68

Exodus 14

of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 31 Israel
also saw the great power that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians, and the
people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah and in his servant
Moses. |15| At that time Moses and the Israelites sang this song to
Jehovah:
“Let me sing to Jehovah, for he has become highly exalted.
The
horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea. 2 My strength and my might is
Jah, since he has become my salvation.
This is my God, and I will praise him;
my father’s God, and I will exalt him. 3 Jehovah is a powerful warrior.
Jehovah is his name. 4 Pharʹaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into
the sea,And his finest warriors have sunk into the Red Sea. 5 The surging
waters covered them; down into the depths they sank like a stone. 6 Your right
hand, O Jehovah, is great in power;Your right hand, O Jehovah, can shatter an
enemy. 7 In your great majesty you can throw down those who rise up against
you;You send out your burning anger, it eats them up like stubble. 8 By a
breath from your nostrils waters massed together;They stood still, holding
back the floods;The surging waters congealed in the heart of the sea. 9 The
enemy said: ‘I will pursue! I will overtake!
I will divide spoil until I am
satisfied!
I will draw my sword! My hand will subdue them!’ 10 You blew with
your breath, the sea covered them;They sank like lead in majestic waters. 11
Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah?
Who is like you, showing yourself
mighty in holiness?
The One to be feared with songs of praise, the One doing
wonders. 12 You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them
up. 13 In your loyal love you have led the people whom you have redeemed;In
your strength you will guide them to your holy place of dwelling. 14 Peoples
must hear; they will shudder;Anguish will seize the inhabitants of
Phi·lisʹti·a. 15 At that time the sheikhs of Eʹdom will be terrified,And
trembling will take hold of the mighty rulers of Moʹab.
All the inhabitants
of Caʹnaan will be disheartened. 16 Fear and dread will fall upon
them.
Because of the greatness of your arm they will be as motionless as a
stoneUntil your people pass by, O Jehovah,Until the people whom you produced
pass by. 17 You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your
inheritance,The established place that you have prepared for yourself to
inhabit, O Jehovah,A sanctuary, O Jehovah, that your hands have established. 
18 Jehovah will rule as king forever and ever. 19 When Pharʹaoh’s horses
with his war chariots and his cavalrymen went into the sea,Then Jehovah
brought back the waters of the sea upon them,But the people of Israel walked
on dry ground through the midst of the sea.“ 20 Then Mirʹi·am the
prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women
followed her with tambourines and with dances. 21 Mirʹi·am sang in response
to the men:
“Sing to Jehovah, for he has become highly exalted.
The horse
and its rider he has hurled into the sea.“ 22 Moses later led Israel away
from the Red Sea, and they went out to the wilderness of Shur and marched on
for three days in the wilderness, but they did not find water. 23 They came to
Maʹrah, but they were not able to drink the water from Maʹrah because it was
bitter. That is why he named it Maʹrah. 24 So the people began to murmur
against Moses, saying: “What are we to drink?“ 25 He cried out to Jehovah,
and Jehovah directed him to a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water
became sweet.
There He established for them a regulation and a case for
judgment, and there He put them to the test. 26 He said: “If you will
strictly listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and will do what is right in
his eyes and will pay attention to his commandments and keep all his
regulations, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon

                                       69

Exodus 15

the Egyptians, for I, Jehovah, am healing you.“ 27 After that they came to
Eʹlim, where there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees. So they camped
there by the water. |16| After they departed from Eʹlim, the entire assembly
of the Israelites eventually came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between
Eʹlim and Siʹnai, on the 15th day of the second month after their departure
from the land of Egypt. 2 Then the entire assembly of the Israelites began to
murmur against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. 3 The Israelites kept saying
to them: “If only we had died by Jehovah’s hand in the land of Egypt while
we were sitting by the pots of meat, while we were eating bread to
satisfaction. Now you have brought us out into this wilderness to put this
whole congregation to death by famine.“ 4 Then Jehovah said to Moses:
“Here I am raining down bread for you from the heavens, and each of the
people should go out to gather his amount day by day, so that I may put them
to the test to see whether they will walk in my law or not. 5 But on the sixth
day when they prepare what they have gathered, it is to be double the amount
that they pick up on each of the other days.“ 6 So Moses and Aaron said to
all the Israelites: “In the evening you will certainly know that it is
Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 7 In the morning you will
see Jehovah’s glory, for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah. Who
are we that you should murmur against us?“ 8 Moses continued: “When
Jehovah gives you meat to eat in the evening and in the morning bread to
satisfaction, you will see that Jehovah has heard your murmurings that you are
murmuring against him. But who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but
against Jehovah.“ 9 Then Moses said to Aaron: “Tell the entire assembly of
the Israelites, ‘Come near before Jehovah, for he has heard your
murmurings.’“ 10 As soon as Aaron had spoken to the entire assembly of the
Israelites, they turned and faced toward the wilderness, and look! Jehovah’s
glory appeared in the cloud. 11 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 12
“I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight
you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread, and
you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God.’“ 13 So that evening
quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning a layer of dew was all
around the camp. 14 When the layer of dew evaporated, there was a fine, flaky
substance on the surface of the wilderness, as fine as frost on the ground. 15
When the Israelites saw it, they began to say to one another, “What is
it?“ for they did not know what it was. Moses said to them: “It is the
bread that Jehovah has given you for food. 16 This is what Jehovah has
commanded, ‘Each one should gather it according to how much he can eat. You
are to take an omer measure for each individual according to the number of the
people that each of you has in his tent.’“ 17 The Israelites began to do
so; they gathered it, some gathering much and some gathering little. 18 When
they would measure it by the omer, the one who had gathered much had no
surplus and the one who had gathered little had no shortage. They each
gathered it according to what they could eat. 19 Then Moses said to them:
“Nobody should leave any of it until the morning.“ 20 But they did not
listen to Moses. When some men left some of it until the morning, it bred
worms and stank, and Moses became indignant at them. 21 They would pick it up
morning by morning, each one according to what he could eat. When the sun got
hot, it melted. 22 On the sixth day, they picked up twice as much bread, two
omer measures for each person. So all the chieftains of the assembly came and
reported it to Moses. 23 At that he said to them: “It is what Jehovah has
said. Tomorrow there will be a complete rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah. Bake

                                       70

Exodus 16

what you need to bake, and boil what you need to boil; then save whatever is
left over and keep it until the morning.“ 24 So they saved it until the
morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink nor were there
maggots in it. 25 Then Moses said: “Eat it today, because today is a sabbath
to Jehovah. Today you will not find it on the ground. 26 You will pick it up
for six days, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.“ 27
However, some of the people did go out to pick it up on the seventh day, but
they found nothing. 28 So Jehovah said to Moses: “How long will you refuse
to keep my commandments and my laws? 29 Take notice of the fact that Jehovah
has given you the Sabbath. That is why he is giving you the bread for two days
on the sixth day. Everyone must stay where he is; nobody is to leave his
locality on the seventh day.“ 30 So the people observed the Sabbath on the
seventh day. 31 The house of Israel named the bread “manna.“ It was white
like coriander seed, and its taste was like that of flat cakes with honey. 32
Then Moses said: “This is what Jehovah has commanded, ‘Fill an omer
measure of it as something to be kept throughout your generations, so that
they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I was
bringing you out of the land of Egypt.’“ 33 So Moses said to Aaron:
“Take a jar and put in it an omer measure of manna and deposit it before
Jehovah as something to be kept throughout your generations.“ 34 Just as
Jehovah commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the Testimony so that it might
be preserved. 35 The Israelites ate the manna for 40 years, until they came to
a land that was inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the frontier
of the land of Caʹnaan. 36 Now an omer is a tenth of an eʹphah measure. |17|
The entire assembly of the Israelites departed from the wilderness of Sin by
stages according to the order of Jehovah, and they camped at Rephʹi·dim. But
there was no water for the people to drink. 2 So the people began quarreling
with Moses and saying: “Give us water to drink.“ But Moses said to them:
“Why are you quarreling with me? Why do you keep putting Jehovah to the
test?“ 3 But the people were very thirsty for water there, and they kept
murmuring against Moses and saying: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt
to kill us and our sons and our livestock with thirst?“ 4 Finally Moses
cried out to Jehovah: “What should I do with this people? A little longer
and they will stone me!“ 5 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go ahead of the
people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel and your rod with which
you struck the Nile River. Take it in your hand and walk on. 6 Look! I will be
standing before you there on the rock in Horʹeb. You must strike the rock,
and water will come out of it, and the people will drink it.“ Moses did so
before the eyes of the elders of Israel. 7 So he named the place Masʹsah and
Merʹi·bah because of the quarreling of the Israelites and because they put
Jehovah to the test by saying: “Is Jehovah in our midst or not?“ 8 Then
the A·malʹek·ites came and fought against Israel in Rephʹi·dim. 9 At this
Moses said to Joshua: “Choose men for us and go out to fight against the
A·malʹek·ites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill, with the rod of
the true God in my hand.“ 10 Then Joshua did just as Moses told him, and he
fought against the A·malʹek·ites. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the
top of the hill. 11 As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up, the Israelites
prevailed, but as soon as he would let down his hands, the A·malʹek·ites
prevailed. 12 When the hands of Moses were heavy, they took a stone and put it
under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur, one on each side, supported
his hands, so that his hands remained steady until the sun set. 13 Thus Joshua
defeated Amʹa·lek and his people with the sword. 14 Jehovah now said to

                                       71

Exodus 17

Moses: “Write this as a memorial in the book and repeat it to Joshua, ‘I
will completely wipe out the memory of Amʹa·lek from under the
heavens.’“ 15 Then Moses built an altar and named it Je·hoʹvah-nisʹsi, 
16 saying: “Because his hand is against the throne of Jah, Jehovah will have
war with Amʹa·lek from generation to generation.“ |18| Now Jethʹro the
priest of Midʹi·an, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had
done for Moses and for his people Israel, how Jehovah had brought Israel out
of Egypt. 2 Jethʹro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken in Zip·poʹrah,
Moses’ wife, when she was sent back to him, 3 along with her two sons. One
son was named Gerʹshom, because Moses said, “I have become a foreign
resident in a foreign land,“ 4 and the other was named E·li·eʹzer,
because he said, “The God of my father is my helper, who rescued me from
Pharʹaoh’s sword.“ 5 So Jethʹro, Moses’ father-in-law, along with
Moses’ sons and his wife, came to Moses into the wilderness where he was
camping at the mountain of the true God. 6 Then he sent word to Moses: “I,
your father-in-law Jethʹro, am coming to you with your wife and her two
sons.“ 7 At once Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down
and kissed him. Each of them asked about the other’s welfare, and then they
went into the tent. 8 Moses related to his father-in-law all that Jehovah had
done to Pharʹaoh and Egypt in behalf of Israel, all the hardships that had
befallen them along the way, and how Jehovah had delivered them. 9 Jethʹro
rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done for Israel by rescuing them
from Egypt. 10 Then Jethʹro said: “Praised be Jehovah, who rescued you from
Egypt and from Pharʹaoh, and who rescued the people from under Egypt’s
control. 11 Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods,
because of what he did to those who acted arrogantly against his people.“ 12
Then Jethʹro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices
for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat a meal with
Moses’ father-in-law before the true God. 13 On the next day, Moses sat down
as usual to serve as judge for the people, and the people kept standing before
Moses from morning until evening. 14 When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that
he was doing for the people, he said: “What is this that you are doing for
the people? Why do you sit here alone with all the people standing before you
from morning until evening?“ 15 Moses said to his father-in-law: “Because
the people keep coming to me to inquire of God. 16 When a case arises, it
comes to me and I must judge between one person and the other, and I make
known the decisions of the true God and his laws.“ 17 Moses’ father-in-law
said to him: “What you are doing is not good. 18 You will surely wear out,
both you and this people who are with you, because this is too big a load for
you and you cannot carry it by yourself. 19 Now listen to me. I will give you
advice, and God will be with you. You serve as representative for the people
before the true God, and you must bring the cases to the true God. 20 You
should warn them about what the regulations and the laws are and make known to
them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do. 21
But you should select from the people capable men fearing God, trustworthy men
hating dishonest profit, and appoint these over them as chiefs over thousands,
chiefs over hundreds, chiefs over fifties, and chiefs over tens. 22 They
should judge the people when cases arise, and they will bring every difficult
case to you, but every minor case they will decide. Make it easier for
yourself by letting them share the load along with you. 23 If you do this, and
God so commands you, you will be able to stand the strain, and everyone will
go home satisfied.“ 24 Moses immediately listened to his father-in-law and

                                       72

Exodus 18

did all that he had said. 25 Moses chose capable men out of all Israel and
appointed them heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of
hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens. 26 So they judged the people
when cases arose. A difficult case they would bring to Moses, but every minor
case they would judge. 27 After that Moses saw his father-in-law off, and he
went his way to his land. |19| In the third month after the Israelites went
out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the wilderness of
Siʹnai. 2 They pulled away from Rephʹi·dim and came to the wilderness of
Siʹnai and camped in the wilderness. Israel camped there in front of the
mountain. 3 Then Moses went up to the true God, and Jehovah called to him from
the mountain, saying: “This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and
to tell the Israelites, 4 ‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to the
Egyptians, in order to carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself. 5
Now if you will strictly obey my voice and keep my covenant, you will
certainly become my special property out of all peoples, for the whole earth
belongs to me. 6 You will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy
nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.“ 7 So
Moses went and summoned the elders of the people and declared to them all
these words that Jehovah had commanded him. 8 After that all the people
answered unanimously: “All that Jehovah has spoken, we are willing to do.“
Moses immediately took the people’s response to Jehovah. 9 And Jehovah said
to Moses: “Look! I am coming to you in a dark cloud, so that the people may
hear when I speak with you and so that they may always put faith in you as
well.“ Then Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah. 10 Then
Jehovah said to Moses: “Go to the people and sanctify them today and
tomorrow, and they must wash their clothing. 11 And they must be ready for the
third day, because on the third day Jehovah will come down upon Mount Siʹnai
before the eyes of all the people. 12 You must set boundaries for the people
all around it and tell them, ‘Beware of going up to the mountain or touching
its border. Anybody touching the mountain will surely be put to death. 13 No
hand is to touch him, but he will either be stoned or be shot through. Whether
beast or man, he will not live.’ But at the sound of the ram’s horn they
may come up to the mountain.“ 14 Then Moses went down from the mountain to
the people, and he began to sanctify the people, and they washed their
clothing. 15 He said to the people: “Get ready for the third day. Abstain
from sexual relations.“ 16 On the morning of the third day, there was
thunder and lightning, and there was a heavy cloud on the mountain and a very
loud sound of a horn, and all the people in the camp began to tremble. 17
Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true God, and they
took their place at the base of the mountain. 18 Mount Siʹnai smoked all
over, because Jehovah came down upon it in fire; and its smoke was rising like
the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling violently. 19 As the
sound of the horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and the voice of the
true God answered him. 20 So Jehovah came down upon Mount Siʹnai to the top
of the mountain. Then Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and
Moses went up. 21 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go down and warn the people
not to try to force their way through to look at Jehovah, or many of them will
perish. 22 And let the priests who regularly come near to Jehovah sanctify
themselves, so that Jehovah may not strike them.“ 23 Moses then said to
Jehovah: “The people are not able to come up to Mount Siʹnai because you
already warned us, saying, ‘Set boundaries around the mountain, and make it
sacred.’“ 24 However, Jehovah said to him: “Go, descend, and come back

                                       73

Exodus 19

up, you and Aaron with you, but do not let the priests and the people force
their way through to come up to Jehovah, so that he may not strike them.“ 25
So Moses descended to the people and told them. |20| Then God spoke all these
words: 2 “I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
out of the house of slavery. 3 You must not have any other gods besides me. 4
“You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that
is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the
earth. 5 You must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them, for I,
Jehovah your God, am a God who requires exclusive devotion, bringing
punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and
upon the fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing loyal love to
the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments. 7
“You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for
Jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes up His name in a worthless
way. 8 “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it sacred. 9 You are to labor and
do all your work for six days, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah
your God. You must not do any work, neither you nor your son nor your daughter
nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your
foreign resident who is inside your settlements. 11 For in six days Jehovah
made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and he began
to rest on the seventh day. That is why Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and
made it sacred. 12 “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live
a long time in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you. 13 “You must
not murder. 14 “You must not commit adultery. 15 “You must not steal. 16
“You must not testify falsely when you are a witness against your fellow
man. 17 “You must not desire your fellow man’s house. You must not desire
your fellow man’s wife nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor
his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man.“ 18 Now all the
people were witnessing the thunder and lightning, the sound of the horn, and
the mountain smoking; and seeing this made them tremble and stand at a
distance. 19 So they said to Moses: “You speak with us, and we will listen,
but do not let God speak with us, for fear that we will die.“ 20 So Moses
said to the people: “Do not be afraid, for the true God has come to put you
to the test, in order that the fear of him may continue with you so that you
may not sin.“ 21 So the people kept standing at a distance, but Moses went
near to the dark cloud where the true God was. 22 Then Jehovah said to Moses:
“This is what you are to say to the Israelites, ‘You have seen for
yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven. 23 You must not make gods of
silver alongside me, and you must not make gods of gold for yourselves. 24 An
altar of earth you are to make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt
offerings, your communion sacrifices, your flock, and your herd. In every
place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and I will
bless you. 25 If you make an altar of stones for me, you must not build it
using stones cut with tools. For if you do use your chisel on it, you will
profane it. 26 And you must not go up by steps to my altar, that your private
parts may not be exposed upon it.’ |21| “These are the judicial decisions
that you are to convey to them: 2 “If you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve
as a slave for six years, but in the seventh year, he will be set free without
paying anything. 3 If he came by himself, he will go out by himself. If he is
the husband of a wife, then his wife must go out with him. 4 If his master
gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her
children will become her master’s, and he will go out by himself. 5 But if

                                       74

Exodus 21

the slave should insist and say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my sons; I
do not want to be set free,’ 6 his master must bring him before the true
God. Then he will bring him up against the door or the doorpost, and his
master will pierce his ear through with an awl, and he will be his slave for
life. 7 “If a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not go free the
same way that a slave man does. 8 If her master is not pleased with her and he
does not designate her as a concubine but causes her to be purchased by
someone else, he will not be entitled to sell her to foreigners, for he has
betrayed her. 9 If he selects her for his son, he is to grant her the rights
of a daughter. 10 If he takes another wife for himself, the sustenance, the
clothing, and the marriage due of the first wife are not to be diminished. 11
If he will not render these three things to her, then she is to go free
without paying any money. 12 “Anyone who strikes a man so that he dies must
be put to death. 13 But if he does it unintentionally and the true God lets it
happen, I will designate for you a place where he can flee. 14 If a man
becomes very angry with his fellow man and he deliberately kills him, the man
must die even if you have to take him from my altar. 15 One who strikes his
father or his mother must be put to death. 16 “If anyone kidnaps a man and
sells him or is caught holding him, he must be put to death. 17 “Anyone who
curses his father or his mother must be put to death. 18 “This is what
should happen if men quarrel and one strikes his fellow man with a stone or a
fist and he does not die but is confined to his bed: 19 If he is able to get
up and walk around outdoors with the aid of a staff, then the one who struck
him must be free from punishment. He will only make compensation for the time
the injured man lost from his work until he is completely healed. 20 “If a
man strikes his slave man or his slave girl with a stick and that one dies by
his hand, that one must be avenged. 21 However, if he survives for one or two
days, he is not to be avenged, because he is someone bought with his owner’s
money. 22 “If men should struggle with each other and they hurt a pregnant
woman and she gives birth prematurely but no fatality results, the offender
must pay the damages imposed on him by the husband of the woman; and he must
pay it through the judges. 23 But if a fatality does occur, then you must give
life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
25 burn for burn, wound for wound, blow for blow. 26 “If a man strikes the
eye of his slave man or the eye of his slave girl and he destroys it, he is to
let the slave go free in compensation for his eye. 27 And if he knocks out the
tooth of his slave man or of his slave girl, he is to let the slave go free in
compensation for his tooth. 28 “If a bull gores a man or a woman and that
one dies, the bull must be stoned to death and its meat is not to be eaten;
but the owner of the bull is free from punishment. 29 But if a bull was in the
habit of goring and its owner had been warned but he would not keep it under
guard and it killed a man or a woman, the bull is to be stoned and its owner
is also to be put to death. 30 If a ransom is imposed on him, he must give as
the redemption price for his life all that may be imposed on him. 31 Whether
it gored a son or a daughter, it is to be done to the bull’s owner according
to this judicial decision. 32 If the bull gored a slave man or a slave girl,
he will give the price of 30 shekels to that one’s master, and the bull will
be stoned to death. 33 “If a man uncovers or digs a pit and does not cover
it and a bull or a donkey falls into it, 34 the owner of the pit is to make
compensation. He is to pay the price to its owner, and the dead animal will
become his. 35 If a man’s bull hurts another’s bull and it dies, then they
must sell the live bull and divide the price paid for it; they should also

                                       75

Exodus 21

divide the dead animal. 36 Or if it was known that a bull had been in the
habit of goring but its owner would not keep it under guard, he must make
compensation with bull for bull, and the dead one will become his own. |22|
“If a man steals a bull or a sheep and he slaughters or sells it, he is to
compensate with five bulls for the bull and four sheep for the sheep. 2 (“If
a thief is found in the act of breaking in and he gets struck and dies, there
is no bloodguilt for him. 3 But if it happens after sunrise, there is
bloodguilt for him.)
“He must make compensation. If he has nothing, then he
must be sold for the things he stole. 4 If what he stole is found alive in his
possession, whether it is a bull or a donkey or a sheep, he is to make double
compensation. 5 “If anyone puts his animals out to graze in a field or a
vineyard and lets them graze in someone else’s field, he is to make
compensation with the best of his own field or with the best of his own
vineyard. 6 “If a fire starts and spreads to thornbushes and it causes
sheaves or standing grain or a field to be consumed, the one who started the
fire must make compensation for what was burned. 7 “If a man gives his
fellow man money or articles to keep and these are stolen from the fellow
man’s house, if the thief is found, he must make double compensation. 8 If
the thief is not found, the owner of the house must be brought before the true
God in order to determine whether he put his hand on the goods of his fellow
man. 9 In all cases of illegal possession of goods, concerning a bull, a
donkey, a sheep, a garment, or anything lost of which he may say, ‘This is
mine!’ both parties will present their case before the true God. The one
whom God pronounces guilty is to make double compensation to his fellow man. 
10 “If a man gives his fellow man a donkey or a bull or a sheep or any
domestic animal to keep and it dies or gets maimed or gets led away while
nobody is looking, 11 there should be an oath made between them before
Jehovah, that he did not lay his hand on the goods of his fellow man; and the
owner must accept it. The other man is not to make compensation. 12 But if the
animal has been stolen from him, he is to make compensation to its owner. 13
If it was torn by a wild animal, he is to bring it as evidence. He is not to
make compensation for something torn by a wild animal. 14 “But if anybody
asks to borrow an animal from his fellow man and it gets maimed or it dies
while its owner is not with it, the man who borrowed it must make
compensation. 15 If its owner is with it, he is not to make compensation. If
it was hired, the money paid for the hire is the compensation. 16 “Now if a
man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and he lies down with her, he must pay
the bride-price for her to become his wife. 17 If her father absolutely
refuses to give her to him, he is to pay the money at the rate of the
bride-price. 18 “You must not allow a sorceress to live. 19 “Anyone lying
down with an animal must surely be put to death. 20 “Whoever sacrifices to
any gods but Jehovah alone is to be devoted to destruction. 21 “You must not
mistreat a foreign resident or oppress him, for you were foreign residents in
the land of Egypt. 22 “You must not afflict any widow or fatherless child. 
23 If you afflict him at all, so that he cries out to me, I will unfailingly
hear his outcry; 24 and my anger will blaze, and I will kill you with the
sword, and your wives will become widows, and your children will be
fatherless. 25 “If you lend money to anyone poor of my people, someone who
is dwelling with you, you must not become like a moneylender to him. You must
not charge him interest. 26 “If you seize the garment of your fellow man as
security for a loan, you are to return it to him by sunset. 27 For it is his
only covering, his clothing to cover his body; in what will he lie down to

                                       76

Exodus 22

sleep? When he cries out to me, I will certainly hear, for I am compassionate.
28 “You must not curse God nor curse a chieftain among your people. 29
“You must not hesitate to make offerings from your abundant produce and the
overflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you are to give to me. 30
This is what you should do with your bull and your sheep: Seven days it will
continue with its mother. On the eighth day, you are to give it to me. 31
“You should prove yourselves holy people to me, and you must not eat the
flesh of anything in the field that has been torn by a wild animal. You should
throw it to the dogs. |23| “You must not spread a report that is not true.
Do not cooperate with a wicked one by becoming a malicious witness. 2 You must
not follow after the crowd to do evil, and you must not pervert justice by
giving testimony to go along with the crowd. 3 You must show impartiality in
the dispute of a poor person. 4 “If you come upon your enemy’s bull or his
donkey straying, you must return it to him. 5 If you see that the donkey of
someone who hates you has fallen under its load, you must not ignore it and
leave. You must help him release the animal. 6 “You are not to pervert the
judgment of the poor one among you in his legal case. 7 “Have nothing to do
with a false accusation, and do not kill the innocent and the righteous, for I
will not declare the wicked one righteous. 8 “You must not accept a bribe,
for the bribe blinds clear-sighted men and can distort the words of righteous
men. 9 “You must not oppress a foreign resident. You know how it feels to be
a foreigner, because you were foreign residents in the land of Egypt. 10
“You are to sow your land with seed and gather its produce for six years. 11
But the seventh year you should leave it uncultivated and let it lie fallow,
and the poor among your people will eat of it, and what they leave, the wild
animals of the field will eat. That is what you should do with your vineyard
and your olive grove. 12 “Six days you are to do your work; but on the
seventh day, you are to cease from your labor, in order that your bull and
your donkey may rest and the son of your slave girl and the foreign resident
may refresh themselves. 13 “You must be careful to do all that I have said
to you, and you must not mention the names of other gods; they should not be
heard on your lips. 14 “Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival
to me. 15 You will observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You will eat
unleavened bread for seven days, just as I have commanded you, at the
appointed time in the month of Aʹbib, for at that time you came out of Egypt.
No one is to appear before me empty-handed. 16 Also, you are to observe the
Festival of Harvest of the first ripe fruits of your labors, of what you sow
in the field; and the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you
gather in from the field the results of your labors. 17 Three times a year all
your men are to appear before the true Lord, Jehovah. 18 “You must not offer
the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened. And the sacrifices of fat
offered at my festivals should not stay overnight until the morning. 19 “You
are to bring the best of the first ripe fruits of your ground to the house of
Jehovah your God.
“You must not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk. 20
“I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you on the way and to bring you
into the place that I have prepared. 21 Pay attention to him, and obey his
voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions,
because my name is in him. 22 However, if you strictly obey his voice and do
all that I say, I will show hostility to your enemies and oppose those who
oppose you. 23 For my angel will go ahead of you and will bring you to the
Amʹor·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the
Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, and I will annihilate them. 24 You must not

Exodus 23

bow down to their gods or be persuaded to serve them, and you must not imitate
their practices. Instead, you must demolish them and smash their sacred
pillars. 25 You must serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless your bread and
your water. I will remove sickness from among you. 26 The women in your land
will not suffer a miscarriage or be barren, and I will give you a full life
span. 27 “I will send the fear of me ahead of you, and I will throw into
confusion all the people you encounter, and I will cause all your enemies to
flee from you in defeat. 28 I will send the feeling of dejection ahead of you,
and it will drive the Hiʹvites, the Caʹnaan·ites, and the Hitʹtites out
from before you. 29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year, so
that the land does not become desolate and the wild animals of the field
multiply against you. 30 Little by little I will drive them out from before
you, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land. 31 “I will
set your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Phi·lisʹtines and from
the wilderness to the River; for I will give the inhabitants of the land into
your hand, and you will drive them out from before you. 32 You must not make a
covenant with them or their gods. 33 They should not dwell in your land, so
that they may not cause you to sin against me. If you should serve their gods,
it would surely become a snare to you.“ |24| Then he said to Moses: “Go up
to Jehovah, you and Aaron, Naʹdab and A·biʹhu, and 70 of the elders of
Israel, and bow down from a distance. 2 Moses should approach Jehovah by
himself; but the others should not approach, and the people should not go up
with him.“ 3 Then Moses came and related to the people all the words of
Jehovah and all the judicial decisions, and all the people answered with one
voice: “All the words that Jehovah has spoken, we are willing to do.“ 4 So
Moses wrote down all the words of Jehovah. Then he got up early in the morning
and built at the foot of the mountain an altar and 12 pillars corresponding to
the 12 tribes of Israel. 5 After that he sent young Israelite men, and they
offered up burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as communion sacrifices to
Jehovah. 6 Then Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and half of
the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 7 Then he took the book of the covenant
and read it aloud to the people. And they said: “All that Jehovah has spoken
we are willing to do, and we will be obedient.“ 8 So Moses took the blood
and sprinkled it on the people and said: “This is the blood of the covenant
that Jehovah has made with you in harmony with all these words.“ 9 Moses and
Aaron, Naʹdab and A·biʹhu, and 70 of the elders of Israel went up, 10 and
they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was what seemed like a sapphire
pavement, and it was as pure as the heavens themselves. 11 He did not harm the
distinguished men of Israel, and they saw a vision of the true God and ate and
drank. 12 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Come up to me on the mountain and stay
there. I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment that
I will write for their instruction.“ 13 So Moses got up with his attendant
Joshua, and Moses went up the mountain of the true God. 14 But to the elders
he had said: “Wait here for us until we return to you. You have Aaron and
Hur with you. Whoever has a legal case may go to them.“ 15 Then Moses went
up the mountain while the cloud was covering it. 16 Jehovah’s glory remained
on Mount Siʹnai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day he
called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 17 To the Israelites who were
watching, the appearance of Jehovah’s glory was like a consuming fire on the
mountaintop. 18 Moses then entered into the cloud and went up the mountain.
And Moses stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights. |25| Jehovah then said
to Moses: 2 “Tell the people of Israel to take up a contribution for me;

                                       78

Exodus 25

from every person whose heart moves him, you are to take up my contribution. 3
This is the contribution that you are to accept from them: gold, silver,
copper, 4 blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, 5
ram skins dyed red, sealskins, acacia wood, 6 oil for the lamps, balsam for
the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense, 7 and onyx stones and other
stones to be set in the ephʹod and the breastpiece. 8 They are to make a
sanctuary for me, and I will reside among them. 9 You are to make it, the
tabernacle and all its furnishings, following exactly the pattern that I am
showing you. 10 “They are to make an ark of acacia wood, two and a half
cubits long and a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high. 11 Then
you will overlay it with pure gold. Inside and outside you are to overlay it,
and you will make a border of gold all around it. 12 And you will cast four
rings of gold for it and attach them above its four feet, with two rings on
one side and two rings on the other side. 13 And you will make poles of acacia
wood and overlay them with gold. 14 You will put the poles through the rings
on the sides of the Ark in order to carry the Ark with them. 15 The poles will
stay in the rings of the Ark; they are not to be removed from it. 16 You will
place in the Ark the Testimony that I will give you. 17 “You will make a
cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 18
You are to make two cherubs of gold; you will make them of hammered work on
the two ends of the cover. 19 Make the cherubs on the two ends, one cherub on
each end of the cover. 20 The cherubs are to spread out their two wings
upward, overshadowing the cover with their wings, and they will face each
other. The faces of the cherubs will be turned toward the cover. 21 You will
put the cover on the Ark, and in the Ark you will place the Testimony that I
will give you. 22 I will present myself to you there and speak with you from
above the cover. From between the two cherubs that are on the ark of the
Testimony, I will make known to you all that I will command you for the
Israelites. 23 “You will also make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long
and a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high. 24 You will overlay it with pure
gold and make a golden border around it. 25 You will make a rim around it a
handbreadth wide and a border of gold to go around the rim. 26 You will make
for it four rings of gold and place the rings on the four corners, where the
four legs are attached. 27 The rings are to be close to the rim as holders for
the poles for carrying the table. 28 You will make the poles of acacia wood
and overlay them with gold and carry the table with them. 29 “You will also
make its dishes, its cups, and its pitchers and bowls from which they will
pour drink offerings. You are to make them out of pure gold. 30 And you will
put the showbread on the table before me constantly. 31 “You will make a
lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand is to be made of hammered work. Its
base, its stem, its branches, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms will be
one piece. 32 And six branches will extend out from the sides of the
lampstand, three branches from one side and three branches from the other
side. 33 Three cups shaped like almond flowers will be on the one set of
branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like
almond flowers on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms
alternating. This is how the six branches will extend out from the stem of the
lampstand. 34 On the stem of the lampstand are four cups shaped like almond
flowers, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating. 35 A knob will be under
the first two branches that extend out of the stem and a knob under the next
two branches and a knob under the next two branches, for the six branches
extending out from the stem. 36 The knobs and the branches and the whole

Exodus 25

lampstand are to be one piece of pure, hammered gold. 37 You will make seven
lamps for it, and when the lamps are lit, they will shine on the area in front
of it. 38 Its snuffers and its fire holders are to be of pure gold. 39 It
should be made, along with these utensils, from a talent of pure gold. 40 See
that you make them after their pattern that was shown to you on the mountain. 
|26| “You are to make the tabernacle with ten tent cloths of fine twisted
linen, blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material. You are to make them
with embroidered cherub designs. 2 Each tent cloth will be 28 cubits long and
4 cubits wide. All the tent cloths are to be the same size. 3 Five tent cloths
are to be joined one to another to form a series, and the other five tent
cloths will be joined in a series. 4 You will make loops of blue thread on the
edge of the one tent cloth at the end of the series, and you are to do the
same on the outermost edge of the other set where it will join. 5 You will
make 50 loops on the one tent cloth and 50 loops on the edge of the other tent
cloth so that they will be opposite each other where they join. 6 You are to
make 50 gold clasps and join the tent cloths together with the clasps, and the
tabernacle will form one unit. 7 “You will also make cloths of goat hair for
the tent over the tabernacle. You will make 11 tent cloths. 8 Each tent cloth
will be 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. All 11 tent cloths are to be the
same size. 9 You are to join five of the tent cloths together and join the
other six tent cloths together, and you are to fold over the sixth tent cloth
at the front of the tent. 10 And you are to make 50 loops on the edge of the
one tent cloth, the outermost one in the series, and 50 loops on the edge of
the tent cloth at the other place where they join. 11 You are to make 50
copper clasps and put the clasps in the loops and join the tent together, and
it will become one unit. 12 The remaining part of the tent cloths will serve
as an overhanging. Half of the tent cloth that remains will hang over the back
of the tabernacle. 13 The remaining length of the cloths of the tent will
serve as an overhanging for the tabernacle by one cubit on each side, in order
to cover it. 14 “You will also make a covering for the tent of ram skins
dyed red and over that a covering of sealskins. 15 “You will make the panel
frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood standing upright. 16 Each panel
frame is to be ten cubits high and a cubit and a half wide. 17 Each panel
frame has two tenons joined to each other. That is how you should make all the
panel frames of the tabernacle. 18 You are to make 20 panel frames for the
south side of the tabernacle, facing south. 19 “You will make 40 silver
socket pedestals under the 20 panel frames: two socket pedestals under the one
panel frame for its two tenons and two socket pedestals under each following
panel frame for its two tenons. 20 For the other side of the tabernacle, the
northern side, make 20 panel frames 21 and their 40 silver socket pedestals,
two socket pedestals under one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each
following panel frame. 22 For the rear section of the tabernacle to the west,
you will make six panel frames. 23 You will make two panel frames to serve as
the two rear corner posts of the tabernacle. 24 They should be doubled from
the bottom to the top, up to the first ring. This should be done for both of
them, and they will form the two corner posts. 25 And there will be eight
panel frames and their 16 silver socket pedestals, two socket pedestals under
the one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame.
26 “You will make bars of acacia wood, five for the panel frames of the one
side of the tabernacle, 27 and five bars for the panel frames of the other
side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the panel frames of the side of the
tabernacle to the west, for the rear section. 28 The middle bar that runs

Exodus 26

along the center of the panel frames should extend from end to end. 29 “You
will overlay the panel frames with gold, and you will make their rings of gold
as holders for the bars, and you will overlay the bars with gold. 30 You must
set up the tabernacle according to its plan that you were shown in the
mountain. 31 “You are to make a curtain of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet
material, and fine twisted linen. It will be made with cherubs embroidered on
it. 32 You will hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold. Their
hooks are to be of gold. The pillars are set on four socket pedestals of
silver. 33 You will hang the curtain under the clasps and bring the ark of the
Testimony there within the curtain. The curtain will make a division for you
between the Holy and the Most Holy. 34 You must put the cover on the ark of
the Testimony in the Most Holy. 35 “You will place the table outside the
curtain, with the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the
tabernacle; and the table you will put on the north side. 36 You will make a
screen for the entrance of the tent out of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet
material, and fine twisted linen woven together. 37 You will make five pillars
of acacia for the screen and overlay them with gold. Their hooks are to be of
gold, and you will cast five socket pedestals of copper for them. |27| “You
will make the altar of acacia wood; it will be five cubits long and five
cubits wide. The altar should be square and three cubits high. 2 You will make
horns on its four corners; the horns will be part of the altar, and you will
overlay the altar with copper. 3 You will make buckets for clearing away its
ashes, along with shovels, bowls, forks, and fire holders, and you will make
all its utensils of copper. 4 You will make a grating for the altar, a network
of copper, and on the network four rings of copper at its four corners. 5 You
will set it down below the rim of the altar, and the network will extend
partway down into the altar. 6 You will make poles of acacia wood for the
altar and overlay them with copper. 7 The poles will be inserted into the
rings so that the poles are on the two sides of the altar when it is carried. 
8 You will make the altar in the form of a hollow chest of planks. It should
be made just as He showed you on the mountain. 9 “You will make the
courtyard of the tabernacle. For the south side, facing south, the courtyard
will have hanging curtains of fine twisted linen, 100 cubits long for the one
side. 10 It will have 20 pillars with 20 copper socket pedestals. The hooks of
the pillars and their connectors are of silver. 11 The hanging curtains for
the north side will also be 100 cubits long, along with its 20 pillars and
their 20 copper socket pedestals, with silver hooks and connectors for the
pillars. 12 There are to be hanging curtains on the west side for 50 cubits
across the width of the courtyard, with ten pillars and ten socket pedestals. 
13 The width of the courtyard on the east side toward the sunrise is 50
cubits. 14 There will be 15 cubits of hanging curtains on the one side, with
three pillars and three socket pedestals. 15 And for the other side, there
will be 15 cubits of hanging curtains, with three pillars and three socket
pedestals. 16 “The entrance of the courtyard should have a screen 20 cubits
long made of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted
linen woven together, with four pillars and their four socket pedestals. 17
All the pillars surrounding the courtyard will have silver fasteners and
silver hooks, but their socket pedestals will be of copper. 18 The courtyard
is to be 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 5 cubits high, made from fine
twisted linen, and it should have copper socket pedestals. 19 All the utensils
and the items used in the service of the tabernacle, as well as its tent pins
and all the pins of the courtyard, are to be of copper. 20 “You are to

Exodus 27

command the Israelites to bring you pure, beaten olive oil for the lighting,
in order to keep the lamps burning constantly. 21 In the tent of meeting,
outside the curtain that is near the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will
arrange to keep the lamps lit from evening until morning before Jehovah. It is
a lasting statute for all their generations to be carried out by the
Israelites. |28| “You are to summon from the Israelites your brother Aaron,
along with his sons, so that he may serve as priest to me—Aaron, along with
Naʹdab and A·biʹhu, El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, the sons of Aaron. 2 You
are to make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and beauty. 3 You
are to speak to all those who are skillful, those whom I have filled with the
spirit of wisdom, and they will make Aaron’s garments for his
sanctification, so that he may serve as priest to me. 4 “These are the
garments that they will make: a breastpiece, an ephʹod, a sleeveless coat, a
checkered robe, a turban, and a sash; they will make these holy garments for
your brother Aaron and his sons, so that he may serve as priest to me. 5 The
skilled workers will use the gold, the blue thread, the purple wool, the
scarlet material, and the fine linen. 6 “They are to make the ephʹod of
gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, and
it should be embroidered. 7 It is to have two shoulder pieces that are joined
at the two top edges. 8 The woven belt, which is attached to the ephʹod for
tying it securely in position, should be of the same materials: gold, blue
thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. 9 “You are to
take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel, 10
six names on the one stone and the six remaining names on the other stone, in
the order of their births. 11 A stone engraver will engrave the names of the
sons of Israel on the two stones as he would engrave a seal. Then you are to
have them mounted in gold settings. 12 You are to put the two stones on the
shoulder pieces of the ephʹod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, and
Aaron must carry their names before Jehovah on his two shoulder pieces as a
memorial. 13 You are to make settings of gold 14 and two chains of pure gold
twisted like a cord, and you must attach the corded chains to the settings. 15
“You are to have an embroiderer make the breastpiece of judgment. It should
be made like the ephʹod, out of gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet
material, and fine twisted linen. 16 It should be square when doubled, a span
long and a span wide. 17 You should set in it mounted stones, four rows of
stones. The first row is ruby, topaz, and emerald. 18 The second row is
turquoise, sapphire, and jasper. 19 The third row is  20 The fourth row is
chrysʹo·lite, onyx, and jade. They should be mounted in settings of gold. 21
The stones will correspond to the names of the 12 sons of Israel. Each one
should be engraved like a seal, each name representing one of the 12 tribes. 
22 “You are to make wreathed chains on the breastpiece, like cords of pure
gold. 23 You are to make two rings of gold for the breastpiece and attach the
two rings to the two ends of the breastpiece. 24 You are to put the two cords
of gold through the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece. 25 You will put
the two ends of the two cords through the two settings, and you must attach
them to the shoulder pieces of the ephʹod, at the front. 26 You are to make
two rings of gold and set them at the two ends on the inside edge of the
breastpiece, facing the ephʹod. 27 You should make two more rings of gold on
the front of the ephʹod, below the two shoulder pieces, close to where it is
joined, above the woven belt of the ephʹod. 28 The breastpiece should be held
in place by a blue cord, tying its rings to the rings of the ephʹod. This
will keep the breastpiece in place on the ephʹod, above the woven belt. 29

Exodus 28

“Aaron must carry the names of the sons of Israel on the breastpiece of
judgment over his heart when he comes into the Holy as a constant memorial
before Jehovah. 30 You will put the Uʹrim and the Thumʹmim into the
breastpiece of judgment, and they must be over Aaron’s heart when he comes
in before Jehovah, and Aaron must carry the means for making judgments of the
Israelites over his heart before Jehovah constantly. 31 “You are to make the
sleeveless coat of the ephʹod entirely of blue thread. 32 There will be an
opening at the top in the middle of it. Its opening should have a border woven
all around it by a loom worker. It should be like the opening of a coat of
mail, so that it will not be torn. 33 You should make pomegranates of blue
thread, purple wool, and scarlet material all around its hem, along with bells
of gold in between them. 34 You should alternate a bell of gold and a
pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the
sleeveless coat. 35 It must be worn by Aaron so that he may minister, and the
sound from it must be heard when he goes into the sanctuary before Jehovah and
when he comes out, so that he will not die. 36 “You are to make a shining
plate of pure gold and engrave on it as one would engrave a seal: ‘Holiness
belongs to Jehovah.’ 37 You must fasten it to the turban with a blue cord;
it is to remain on the front of the turban. 38 It will be on Aaron’s
forehead, and Aaron will bear responsibility when someone commits an error
against the holy things, which the Israelites sanctify when they offer them as
holy gifts. It must always remain on his forehead, so that they may gain
approval before Jehovah. 39 “You are to weave the checkered robe of fine
linen, make a turban of fine linen, and make a woven sash. 40 “You will also
make robes, sashes, and headgear for Aaron’s sons, for glory and beauty. 41
You will clothe your brother Aaron and his sons with him, and you are to
anoint them and install them and sanctify them, and they will serve as priests
to me. 42 Also make linen shorts for them to cover their naked flesh. These
are to extend from the hips to the thighs. 43 These must be worn by Aaron and
his sons when they come into the tent of meeting or when they approach the
altar to minister in the holy place, so that they may not incur guilt and die.
It is a permanent statute for him and his offspring after him. |29| “This is
what you are to do to sanctify them to serve as priests to me: Take a young
bull, two unblemished rams, 2 unleavened bread, unleavened ring-shaped loaves
mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil. You are to make them
with fine wheat flour 3 and put them in a basket and present them in the
basket, along with the bull and the two rams. 4 “You will present Aaron and
his sons at the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water. 5
Then you are to take the garments and clothe Aaron with the robe, the
sleeveless coat of the ephʹod, the ephʹod, and the breastpiece, and you are
to tie the woven belt of the ephʹod securely around his waist. 6 You will put
the turban on his head and put the holy sign of dedication on the turban; 7
and take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him. 8 “Then
bring his sons forward and clothe them with the robes 9 and wrap the sashes
around them, Aaron as well as his sons, and put on their headgear; and the
priesthood will become theirs as a permanent statute. This is how you should
install Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. 10 “You are now to present
the bull before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons will lay their
hands on the bull’s head. 11 Slaughter the bull before Jehovah, at the
entrance of the tent of meeting. 12 Take some of the bull’s blood on your
finger and put it on the horns of the altar, and pour out all the rest of the
blood at the base of the altar. 13 Then take all the fat that covers the

Exodus 29

intestines, the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that
is on them, and burn them so that they smoke on the altar. 14 But the bull’s
flesh and its skin and its dung, you will burn with fire outside the camp. It
is a sin offering. 15 “Then take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons are to
lay their hands on the ram’s head. 16 Slaughter the ram and take its blood
and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar. 17 Cut the ram into its pieces, and
wash its intestines and its shanks, and arrange the pieces together with its
head. 18 You must burn the entire ram, making it smoke on the altar. It is a
burnt offering to Jehovah, a pleasing aroma. It is an offering made by fire to
Jehovah. 19 “Next you are to take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons are
to lay their hands on the ram’s head. 20 Slaughter the ram and take some of
its blood and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe and on his sons’ right
earlobe and on the thumb of their right hand and the big toe of their right
foot, and sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar. 21 Then take some of
the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil and spatter it on
Aaron and his garments and on his sons and his sons’ garments, so that he
and his garments and his sons and their garments may be holy. 22 “Then take
from the ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the intestines, the
appendage of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and the
right leg, for it is a ram of installation. 23 Take also a round loaf of bread
and a ring-shaped loaf of oiled bread and a wafer out of the basket of
unleavened bread that is before Jehovah. 24 You must place them all in the
hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and you are to wave them back and
forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 25 Then you will take them out of
their hands and burn them on the altar, on top of the burnt offering, as a
pleasing aroma before Jehovah. It is an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 26
“Then take the breast of the ram of installation, which is offered in behalf
of Aaron, and wave it back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah, and it
will become your portion. 27 You are to sanctify the breast of the wave
offering and the leg of the sacred portion that was waved and that was taken
from the ram of installation, from what was offered for Aaron and for his
sons. 28 It is to become Aaron’s and his sons’ by a permanent regulation
to be carried out by the Israelites, for it is a sacred portion, and it will
become a sacred portion to be given by the Israelites. It is their sacred
portion for Jehovah from their communion sacrifices. 29 “The holy garments
that belong to Aaron will be used by his sons after him when they are anointed
and installed as priests. 30 The priest from among his sons who succeeds him
and who comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place will wear
them for seven days. 31 “You will take the ram of installation and boil its
flesh in a holy place. 32 Aaron and his sons will eat the flesh of the ram and
the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 33
They are to eat the things with which atonement was made to install them as
priests and to sanctify them. But an unauthorized person may not eat them, for
they are something holy. 34 If any of the flesh of the installation sacrifice
and of the bread is left over until the morning, then you must burn what is
left with fire. It must not be eaten, for it is something holy. 35 “You are
to do this way to Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded
you. You will take seven days to install them as priests. 36 You will offer
the bull of the sin offering daily for an atonement, and you are to purify the
altar from sin by making atonement for it, and you must anoint it to sanctify
it. 37 You will take seven days to make atonement for the altar, and you must
sanctify it so that it may become a most holy altar. Anyone who touches the

Exodus 29

altar is to be holy. 38 “This is what you will offer on the altar: two
one-year-old rams each day, continually. 39 Offer the one young ram in the
morning and the other ram at twilight. 40 A tenth part of an eʹphah measure
of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a drink offering
of a fourth of a hin of wine, will go for the first young ram. 41 You will
offer the second young ram at twilight, along with the same grain and drink
offerings as in the morning. You will render it as a pleasing aroma, an
offering made by fire to Jehovah. 42 It is to be a regular burnt offering
throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before
Jehovah, where I will present myself to you to speak to you there. 43 “I
will present myself there to the Israelites, and it will be sanctified by my
glory. 44 I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar, and I will
sanctify Aaron and his sons so that they may serve as priests to me. 45 I will
reside among the people of Israel, and I will be their God. 46 And they will
certainly know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land
of Egypt so that I may reside among them. I am Jehovah their God. |30| “You
are to make an altar as a place for burning incense; you will make it of
acacia wood. 2 It should be square, one cubit long, one cubit wide, and two
cubits high. Its horns will be one piece with it. 3 You are to overlay it with
pure gold: its top surface, its sides all around, and its horns; and you are
to make a gold border around it. 4 You will also make two rings of gold for it
below its border on two opposite sides, and these will hold the poles used to
carry it. 5 Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 6 You
are to put it before the curtain that is near the ark of the Testimony, before
the cover that is over the Testimony, where I will present myself to you. 7
“Aaron will burn perfumed incense on it, making it smoke on the altar when
he maintains the lamps each morning. 8 Also, when Aaron lights the lamps at
twilight, he will burn the incense. It is a regular incense offering before
Jehovah throughout your generations. 9 You must not offer on it unauthorized
incense or a burnt offering or a grain offering, and you must not pour a drink
offering on it. 10 Aaron must make atonement on its horns once a year. With
some of the blood of the sin offering of the atonement, he will make atonement
for it once a year throughout your generations. It is most holy to Jehovah.“
11 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 12 “Whenever you take a census and count the
sons of Israel, each one must give a ransom for his life to Jehovah at the
time of the census. This is so that no plague may be brought upon them when
they are registered. 13 This is what all those who are registered will give: a
half shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place. Twenty geʹrahs equal a
shekel. A half shekel is the contribution to Jehovah. 14 Everyone registered
who is 20 years old and up will give Jehovah’s contribution. 15 The rich
should not give more and the poor should not give less than the half shekel as
a contribution to Jehovah to make atonement for your lives. 16 You are to take
the silver money of the atonement from the Israelites and give it in behalf of
the service of the tent of meeting, that it may serve as a remembrance before
Jehovah for the Israelites, to make atonement for your lives.“ 17 Jehovah
spoke further to Moses, saying: 18 “Make a copper basin and its stand for
washing; then place it between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water
into it. 19 Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet there. 20
When they go into the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar to
minister and to make offerings of fire and smoke to Jehovah, they will wash
with water so that they do not die. 21 They must wash their hands and their
feet so that they may not die, and it must serve as a permanent regulation for

                                       85

Exodus 30

them, for him and his offspring, throughout their generations.“ 22 Jehovah
continued to speak to Moses: 23 “Next, take the choicest perfumes: 500 units
of solidified myrrh, and half that amount, 250 units, of sweet cinnamon, 250
units of sweet calamus, 24 and 500 units of cassia, measured by the standard
shekel of the holy place, along with a hin of olive oil. 25 Then make out of
it a holy anointing oil; it should be skillfully blended together. It is to be
a holy anointing oil. 26 “You are to anoint the tent of meeting and the ark
of the Testimony with it, 27 as well as the table and all its utensils, the
lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 28 the altar of burnt
offering and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand. 29 You must
sanctify them that they may become most holy. Anyone touching them is to be
holy. 30 And you will anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them to serve as
priests to me. 31 “You will speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘This is to
continue as a holy anointing oil to me during your generations. 32 It is not
to be applied to the flesh of mankind, and you must not make anything with a
composition like it. It is something holy. It is to continue as something holy
for you. 33 Anyone who makes an ointment like it and who puts some of it on an
unauthorized person must be cut off from his people.’“ 34 Then Jehovah
said to Moses: “Take equal portions of these perfumes: stacte drops, onycha,
perfumed galbanum, and pure frankincense. 35 Make it into an incense; the
spice mixture should be skillfully blended, salted, pure, and holy. 36 You are
to pound some of it into fine powder and put some of it before the Testimony
in the tent of meeting, where I will present myself to you. It should be most
holy to you. 37 You must not make for your own use the incense that you make
with this composition. You are to regard it as something holy to Jehovah. 38
Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its smell must be cut off from his
people.“ |31| Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 “See, I have
chosen Bezʹal·el the son of Uʹri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah. 3 I
will fill him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, and
knowledge of every kind of craftsmanship, 4 for making artistic designs, for
working with gold, silver, and copper, 5 for cutting and setting stones, and
for making every kind of wood product. 6 Moreover, to assist him I have
appointed O·hoʹli·ab the son of A·hisʹa·mach of the tribe of Dan, and I
am putting wisdom into the heart of all those who are skillful, so that they
may make everything I have commanded you: 7 the tent of meeting, the ark of
the Testimony and the cover that is on it, all the equipment of the tent, 8
the table and its utensils, the lampstand of pure gold and all its utensils,
the altar of incense, 9 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the
basin and its stand, 10 the finely woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron
the priest, the garments of his sons to serve as priests, 11 the anointing
oil, and the perfumed incense for the sanctuary. They will do everything I
have commanded you.“ 12 Jehovah said further to Moses: 13 “Speak to the
Israelites and tell them, ‘Especially, you are to keep my sabbaths, for it
is a sign between me and you during your generations in order that you may
know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you. 14 You must keep the Sabbath, for it
is something holy to you. Whoever profanes it must be put to death. If anyone
does any work on it, then that person must be cut off from among his people. 
15 Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete
rest. It is something holy to Jehovah. Anyone doing work on the Sabbath day
must be put to death. 16 The Israelites must keep the Sabbath; they must
observe the Sabbath during all their generations. It is a lasting covenant. 17
It is an enduring sign between me and the people of Israel, for in six days

Exodus 31

Jehovah made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he rested and
refreshed himself.’“ 18 Now as soon as he had finished speaking with him
on Mount Siʹnai, he gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone
written on by God’s finger. |32| Meanwhile, the people saw that Moses was
taking a long time coming down from the mountain. So the people gathered
around Aaron and said to him: “Get up, make for us a god who will go ahead
of us, because we do not know what has happened to this Moses, the man who led
us up out of the land of Egypt.“ 2 At this Aaron said to them: “Take the
gold earrings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and
bring them to me.“ 3 So all the people began taking off the gold earrings
that were in their ears and bringing them to Aaron. 4 Then he took the gold
from them, and he formed it with an engraving tool and made it into a statue
of a calf. They began to say: “This is your God, O Israel, who led you up
out of the land of Egypt.“ 5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before
it. Then Aaron called out: “There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.“ 6 So
they got up early on the next day and began offering up burnt offerings and
presenting communion sacrifices. After that the people sat down to eat and
drink. Then they got up to have a good time. 7 Jehovah now said to Moses:
“Go, descend, because your people, whom you led up out of the land of Egypt,
have corrupted themselves. 8 They have quickly deviated from the way I
commanded them to go. They have made for themselves a statue of a calf, and
they keep bowing down to it and sacrificing to it and saying, ‘This is your
God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.’“ 9 Jehovah went
on to say to Moses: “I have seen that this is an obstinate people. 10 So now
let me be, and I will exterminate them in my burning anger, and let me make a
great nation from you instead.“ 11 Then Moses appealed to Jehovah his God
and said: “Why, O Jehovah, should you turn your burning anger against your
people after bringing them out of the land of Egypt with great power and with
a mighty hand? 12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He had evil intentions when
he led them out. He wanted to kill them in the mountains and exterminate them
from the surface of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger and reconsider
your decision to bring this calamity on your people. 13 Remember your servants
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom you swore by yourself and said: ‘I will
multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens, and I will give all
this land that I have designated to your offspring, so that they may take it
as a permanent possession.’“ 14 So Jehovah began to reconsider the
calamity that he had spoken of bringing on his people. 15 Moses then turned
and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his
hand. The tablets were inscribed on both sides; they were written on the front
and on the back. 16 The tablets were the workmanship of God, and the writing
was the writing of God engraved on the tablets. 17 When Joshua began to hear
the noise of the people because of their shouting, he said to Moses: “There
is the sound of battle in the camp.“ 18 But Moses said:
“It is not the
sound of singing over a victory,And it is not the sound of wailing over a
defeat;I hear the sound of another kind of singing.“ 19 As soon as Moses got
near the camp and saw the calf and the dances, his anger began to blaze, and
he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the
mountain. 20 He took the calf that they had made and he burned it with fire
and crushed it into powder; then he scattered it on the water and made the
Israelites drink it. 21 And Moses said to Aaron: “What did this people do to
you that you have brought a great sin upon them?“ 22 Aaron replied: “Do
not be enraged, my lord. You well know that the people are inclined to do

                                       87

Exodus 32

evil. 23 So they said to me, ‘Make for us a god who will go ahead of us, for
we do not know what has happened to this Moses, the man who led us up out of
the land of Egypt.’ 24 So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold must take
it off and give it to me.’ Then I threw it into the fire and out came this
calf.“ 25 Moses saw that the people were unrestrained, for Aaron had let
them go unrestrained, so that they were a disgrace before their opposers. 26
Then Moses took his position in the gate of the camp and said: “Who is on
Jehovah’s side? Come to me!“ And all the Levites gathered around him. 27
He now said to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said,
‘Each of you must fasten on his sword and pass through all the camp from
gate to gate, killing his brother, his neighbor, and his close
companion.’“ 28 The Levites did what Moses said. So about 3,000 men were
killed on that day. 29 Then Moses said: “Set yourselves apart for Jehovah
today, for each of you has gone against his own son and his own brother; today
he will give you a blessing.“ 30 On the very next day, Moses said to the
people: “You committed a very great sin, and now I will go up to Jehovah to
see if I can make amends for your sin.“ 31 So Moses returned to Jehovah and
said: “What a great sin this people has committed! They made themselves a
god of gold! 32 But now if you are willing, pardon their sin; if not, please
wipe me out from your book that you have written.“ 33 However, Jehovah said
to Moses: “Whoever has sinned against me, I will wipe him out of my book. 34
Go now, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you. Look!
My angel will go ahead of you, and on the day when I make an accounting, I
will bring punishment on them for their sin.“ 35 Then Jehovah began plaguing
the people because they had made the calf, the one that Aaron had made. |33|
Jehovah said further to Moses: “Go on your way from here with the people
whom you led up out of the land of Egypt. Journey to the land about which I
swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give
it.’ 2 I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Caʹnaan·ites,
the Amʹor·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the
Jebʹu·sites. 3 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not
go in the midst of you, for you are an obstinate people, and I might
exterminate you on the way.“ 4 When the people heard this harsh word, they
began to mourn, and not one of them put on his ornaments. 5 Jehovah said to
Moses: “Say to the Israelites, ‘You are an obstinate people. In one moment
I could go through the midst of you and exterminate you. So now keep your
ornaments off while I consider what to do to you.’“ 6 So from Mount
Horʹeb onward, the Israelites refrained from wearing their ornaments. 7 Now
Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, at some distance from the
camp, and he called it a tent of meeting. Everyone inquiring of Jehovah would
go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp. 8 As soon as Moses
went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of
their own tents, and they would gaze after Moses until he entered into the
tent. 9 As soon as Moses would go into the tent, the pillar of cloud would
come down and stand at the entrance of the tent while God spoke with Moses. 10
When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the
tent, each of them rose and bowed down at the entrance of his own tent. 11
Jehovah spoke to Moses face-to-face, just as one man would speak to another
man. When he returned to the camp, Joshua the son of Nun, his minister and
attendant, would not depart from the tent. 12 Now Moses said to Jehovah:
“See, you are saying to me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but you have not let
me know whom you will send with me. Moreover, you have said, ‘I know you by

                                       88

Exodus 33

name, and you have also found favor in my eyes.’ 13 Please, if I have found
favor in your eyes, make me know your ways, so that I may know you and
continue to find favor in your eyes. Consider, too, that this nation is your
people.“ 14 So he said: “I myself will go with you, and I will give you
rest.“ 15 Then Moses said to him: “If you yourself are not going along, do
not lead us up from here. 16 How will it be known that I have found favor in
your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going along with us, so that I
and your people will be distinguished from every other people on the face of
the earth?“ 17 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “I will also do this thing
that you request, because you have found favor in my eyes and I know you by
name.“ 18 Then he said: “Please show me your glory.“ 19 But he said:
“I will make all my goodness pass before your face, and I will declare
before you the name of Jehovah; and I will favor the one whom I favor, and I
will show mercy to the one to whom I show mercy.“ 20 But he added: “You
cannot see my face, for no man can see me and live.“ 21 Jehovah said
further: “Here is a place near me. Station yourself on the rock. 22 When my
glory is passing by, I will place you in a crevice of the rock, and I will
shield you with my hand until I have passed by. 23 After that I will take my
hand away, and you will see my back. But my face may not be seen.“ |34| Then
Jehovah said to Moses: “Carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the
first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the
first tablets, which you shattered. 2 Get ready for the morning, as you will
go up in the morning to Mount Siʹnai and station yourself before me there on
the top of the mountain. 3 But nobody may go up with you, and nobody else
should be seen anywhere on the mountain. Not even the flocks or herds should
graze in front of that mountain.“ 4 So Moses carved out two tablets of stone
like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went up Mount Siʹnai,
just as Jehovah had commanded him, and he took the two tablets of stone in his
hand. 5 Then Jehovah came down in the cloud and stationed himself with him
there and declared the name of Jehovah. 6 Jehovah was passing before him and
declaring: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to
anger and abundant in loyal love and truth, 7 showing loyal love to thousands,
pardoning error and transgression and sin, but he will by no means leave the
guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and
upon grandsons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.“ 8
Moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself. 9 Then he said:
“If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, O Jehovah, then please, Jehovah,
go along with us in our midst, although we are an obstinate people, and
forgive our error and our sin, and take us as your own possession.“ 10 In
turn he said: “Here I am making a covenant: Before all your people, I will
do wonderful things that have never been done in all the earth or among all
the nations, and all the people among whom you live will see the work of
Jehovah, for it is an awe-inspiring thing that I am doing with you. 11 “Pay
attention to what I am commanding you today. Here I am driving out from before
you the Amʹor·ites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites,
the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites. 12 Be careful that you do not make a
covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it may
prove to be a snare among you. 13 But you are to pull down their altars, you
are to shatter their sacred pillars, and their sacred poles you are to cut
down. 14 You must not bow down to another god, for Jehovah is known for
requiring exclusive devotion. Yes, he is a God who requires exclusive
devotion. 15 Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the

Exodus 34

land, because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to
their gods, someone will invite you and you will eat from his sacrifice. 16
Then you will surely take some of their daughters for your sons, and their
daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to
prostitute themselves to their gods. 17 “You must not make gods of cast
metal. 18 “You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You will eat
unleavened bread, just as I have commanded you; do this for seven days at the
appointed time in the month of Aʹbib, because it was in the month of Aʹbib
that you came out of Egypt. 19 “Every firstborn male is mine, including all
your livestock, whether the first male bull or sheep. 20 The firstling of a
donkey you are to redeem with a sheep. But if you do not redeem it, then you
must break its neck. You are to redeem every firstborn of your sons. No one
may appear before me empty-handed. 21 “Six days you are to work, but on the
seventh day you will rest. Even during plowing time and in harvest, you will
rest. 22 “And you will celebrate your Festival of Weeks with the first ripe
fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of
the year. 23 “Three times a year, all your men are to appear before the true
Lord, Jehovah, the God of Israel. 24 For I will drive the nations away from
before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and nobody will desire your
land while you are going up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times a
year. 25 “You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice along with anything
leavened. The sacrifice of the festival of the Passover should not be kept
overnight until the morning. 26 “The best of the first ripe fruits of your
soil you are to bring to the house of Jehovah your God.
“You must not boil a
young goat in its mother’s milk.“ 27 Jehovah went on to say to Moses:
“You are to write down these words, because in accordance with these words,
I am making a covenant with you and with Israel.“ 28 And he remained there
with Jehovah 40 days and 40 nights. He ate no bread and drank no water. And He
wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments. 29 Moses
then came down from Mount Siʹnai, and the two tablets of the Testimony were
in his hand. When he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the
skin of his face was emitting rays because he had been speaking with God. 30
When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, they noticed that the skin of his
face emitted rays and they were afraid to go near him. 31 But Moses called to
them, so Aaron and all the chieftains of the assembly came to him, and Moses
spoke with them. 32 After that all the Israelites came near to him, and he
gave them all the commands that Jehovah had given him on Mount Siʹnai. 33
When Moses would finish speaking with them, he would put a veil over his face.
34 But when Moses would go in before Jehovah to speak with him, he would take
off the veil until he went out. Then he went out and revealed to the
Israelites the commands he had received. 35 And the Israelites saw that the
skin of Moses’ face emitted rays; then Moses put the veil back over his face
until he went in to speak with God. |35| Moses later gathered the entire
assembly of the Israelites together and said to them: “These are the things
that Jehovah has commanded to be done: 2 Work may be done for six days, but
the seventh day will become something holy to you, a sabbath of complete rest
to Jehovah. Anybody doing work on it will be put to death. 3 You must not
light a fire in any of your dwelling places on the Sabbath day.“ 4 Moses
then said to the entire assembly of the Israelites: “This is what Jehovah
has commanded, 5 ‘Take up a contribution for Jehovah from among yourselves.
Let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution for Jehovah: gold,
silver, copper, 6 blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat

hair, 7 ram skins dyed red, sealskins, acacia wood, 8 oil for the lamps,
balsam for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense, 9 onyx stones, and
other stones for setting in the ephʹod and the breastpiece. 10 “‘Let all
who are skilled among you come and make everything that Jehovah has commanded,
11 namely, the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, its clasps and its
panel frames, its bars, its pillars, and its socket pedestals; 12 the Ark and
its poles, the cover, and the curtain for the screen; 13 the table and its
poles and all its utensils and the showbread; 14 the lampstand for light and
its utensils and its lamps and the oil for lighting; 15 the altar of incense
and its poles; the anointing oil and the perfumed incense; the screen for the
tabernacle’s entrance; 16 the altar of burnt offering and its copper
grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin and its stand; 17 the
hanging curtains of the courtyard, its pillars and its socket pedestals; the
screen of the entrance to the courtyard; 18 the tent pins of the tabernacle
and the tent pins of the courtyard and their cords; 19 the finely woven
garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the
priest, and the garments of his sons for serving as priests.’“ 20 So all
the assembly of the Israelites went out from before Moses. 21 Then everyone
whose heart impelled him and everyone whose spirit incited him came and
brought their contribution for Jehovah to be used for the tent of meeting, for
all its service, and for the holy garments. 22 They kept coming, the men along
with the women, each with a willing heart, bringing brooches, earrings, rings,
and other jewelry, as well as all sorts of articles of gold. They all
presented their offerings of gold to Jehovah. 23 And all who had blue thread,
purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, and
sealskins brought them. 24 All those contributing silver and copper brought
Jehovah’s contribution, and all who had acacia wood for any part of the work
brought it. 25 All the skilled women spun with their hands, and they brought
what they had spun: blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine
linen. 26 And all the skilled women whose hearts impelled them spun the goat
hair. 27 And the chieftains brought onyx stones and other stones to be set in
the ephʹod and the breastpiece, 28 and the balsam and the oil for lighting
and for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense. 29 All the men and
women whose hearts incited them brought something for the work that Jehovah,
through Moses, had commanded to be done; the Israelites brought it as a
voluntary offering to Jehovah. 30 Then Moses said to the Israelites: “See,
Jehovah has chosen Bezʹal·el the son of Uʹri the son of Hur of the tribe of
Judah. 31 He has filled him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom,
understanding, and knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship 32 for making
artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper, 33 for cutting
and setting stones, and for making all kinds of artistic wood products. 34 And
he has put it into his heart to teach, he and O·hoʹli·ab the son of
A·hisʹa·mach of the tribe of Dan. 35 He has filled them with skill to do
all the work of a craftsman, an embroiderer, and a weaver using blue thread,
purple wool, scarlet material, and fine linen, and of a loom worker. These men
will do every sort of work and prepare every sort of design. |36|
“Bezʹal·el will work along with O·hoʹli·ab and every skilled man to
whom Jehovah has given wisdom and understanding so as to know how to do all
the work of the holy service just as Jehovah has commanded.“ 2 Moses then
called Bezʹal·el and O·hoʹli·ab and every skilled man into whose heart
Jehovah had put wisdom, everyone whose heart impelled him to volunteer to do
the work. 3 Then they took from Moses all the contribution that the Israelites

                                       91

---

Exodus 36

had brought for the work of the holy service. However, these continued to
bring him voluntary offerings, morning after morning. 4 Then after they
started the holy work, all the skilled workers were coming, one after another,
5 and they were telling Moses: “The people are bringing much more than what
is required for the work that Jehovah has commanded to be done.“ 6 So Moses
commanded that an announcement be made throughout the camp, saying: “Men and
women, do not bring any more goods for the holy contribution.“ With that the
people were restrained from bringing in anything else. 7 The goods were enough
for all the work to be done, and more than enough. 8 So all the skilled
workers made the tabernacle of ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen, blue
thread, purple wool, and scarlet material; he made them with cherubs
embroidered on them. 9 Each tent cloth was 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide.
All the tent cloths were the same size. 10 Then he joined five of the tent
cloths together, and the other five tent cloths he joined together. 11 After
that he made loops of blue thread on the edge of the one tent cloth where it
would join. He did the same on the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the
corresponding place where it would join. 12 He made 50 loops on the one tent
cloth and 50 loops on the other edge of the tent cloth at the place where it
would join so that the loops would be opposite one another. 13 Finally, he
made 50 gold clasps and joined the tent cloths together with the clasps, so
that the tabernacle became one unit. 14 Then he made tent cloths of goat hair
for the tent over the tabernacle. He made 11 tent cloths. 15 Each tent cloth
was 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. The 11 tent cloths were the same size. 
16 Then he joined five of the tent cloths together, and he joined the other
six tent cloths together. 17 Next he made 50 loops along the edge of the
outermost tent cloth where it joined, and he made 50 loops along the edge of
the other tent cloth that joined with it. 18 And he made 50 copper clasps for
joining the tent together to become one unit. 19 He made a covering for the
tent out of ram skins dyed red and a covering out of sealskins to go over
that. 20 Then he made out of acacia wood the tabernacle’s panel frames,
which stood upright. 21 Each panel frame was ten cubits high and one and a
half cubits wide. 22 Each panel frame had two tenons joined to each other.
That is how he made all the panel frames of the tabernacle. 23 Thus he made
the panel frames for the south side of the tabernacle, 20 panel frames, facing
south. 24 Then he made 40 socket pedestals of silver to go under the 20 panel
frames, two socket pedestals beneath one panel frame for its two tenons and
two socket pedestals under each following panel frame for its two tenons. 25
For the other side of the tabernacle, the northern side, he made 20 panel
frames 26 and their 40 socket pedestals of silver, two socket pedestals
beneath the one panel frame and two socket pedestals beneath each of the other
panel frames. 27 For the rear section of the tabernacle to the west, he made
six panel frames. 28 He made two panel frames as corner posts of the
tabernacle at the two rear corners. 29 The posts were doubled from the bottom
to the top, up to the first ring. That is what he did with the two corner
posts. 30 So they amounted to eight panel frames along with their 16 socket
pedestals of silver, two socket pedestals under each panel frame. 31 Then he
made bars of acacia wood, five bars for the panel frames of the one side of
the tabernacle 32 and five bars for the panel frames of the other side of the
tabernacle and five for the panel frames of the tabernacle for the rear
section to the west. 33 He made the middle bar to extend along the middle of
the panel frames from one end to the other. 34 He overlaid the panel frames
with gold, and he made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and he

overlaid the bars with gold. 35 Then he made a curtain of blue thread, purple
wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. He made it with cherubs
embroidered on it. 36 Then he made for it four acacia pillars and overlaid
them with gold, along with hooks of gold, and cast four socket pedestals of
silver for them. 37 Next he made a screen for the entrance of the tent out of
blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen woven
together, 38 as well as its five pillars and their hooks. He overlaid their
tops and their connectors with gold, but their five socket pedestals were of
copper. |37| Bezʹal·el then made the Ark of acacia wood. It was two and a
half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high. 2 He
overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and made a border of gold around
it. 3 After that he cast four rings of gold for it, for above its four feet,
with two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side. 4 He next made
poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 5 Then he put the poles
through the rings on the sides of the Ark for carrying the Ark. 6 He made the
cover of pure gold. It was two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half
wide. 7 He then made two cherubs of hammered gold on both ends of the cover. 8
One cherub was on one end, and the other cherub on the other end. He made the
cherubs on both ends of the cover. 9 The two cherubs spread out their wings
upward, overshadowing the cover with their wings. They were facing each other,
and their faces were turned toward the cover. 10 He then made the table of
acacia wood. It was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half
high. 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold and made a border of gold around
it. 12 Next he made a rim the width of a handbreadth to go around it and a
border of gold to go around the rim. 13 Further, he cast four rings of gold
for it and placed the rings on the four corners where the four legs were
attached. 14 The rings were near the rim, as holders for the poles used for
carrying the table. 15 Then he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them
with gold for carrying the table. 16 After that he made out of pure gold the
utensils that went on the table—its dishes, its cups, and its bowls and
pitchers from which drink offerings would be poured. 17 Then he made the
lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work. Its base, its
stem, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms were one piece. 18 Six branches
were extending out from its stem, three branches of the lampstand from its one
side and three branches from its other side. 19 Three cups shaped like almond
flowers were on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating,
and three cups shaped like almond flowers were on the other set of branches,
with knobs and blossoms alternating. This was done for the six branches
extending out from the stem of the lampstand. 20 And on the stem of the
lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers, with knobs and blossoms
alternating. 21 There was a knob under the first two branches that extended
out of the stem and a knob under the next two branches and a knob under the
next two branches, for the six branches extending out from the stem of the
lampstand. 22 The knobs and the branches and the whole lampstand were made to
be one piece of pure, hammered gold. 23 Then he made its seven lamps and its
snuffers and its fire holders out of pure gold. 24 He made it, along with all
its utensils, from a talent of pure gold. 25 He now made the altar of incense
out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits
high. Its horns were one piece with it. 26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its
top surface and its sides all around and its horns, and he made a border of
gold around it. 27 He made two rings of gold for it below its border on two
opposite sides to hold the poles used for carrying it. 28 After that he made

the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 29 He also made the holy
anointing oil and the pure, perfumed incense, skillfully blended. |38| He made
the altar of burnt offering out of acacia wood. It was square, five cubits
long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 2 Then he made its horns on its
four corners. Its horns were one piece with it. Next he overlaid it with
copper. 3 After that he made all the utensils of the altar, the buckets, the
shovels, the bowls, the forks, and the fire holders. All its utensils he made
of copper. 4 He also made a grating for the altar, a network of copper, under
its rim, down toward its center. 5 He cast four rings on the four corners near
the grating of copper, as holders for the poles. 6 After that he made the
poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with copper. 7 He inserted the poles
into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. He made the altar in
the form of a hollow chest of planks. 8 Then he made the basin of copper and
its copper stand; he used the mirrors of the women who were organized to serve
at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 9 Then he made the courtyard. For the
south side of the courtyard, facing south, he made the hanging curtains of
fine twisted linen, for 100 cubits. 10 There were 20 pillars and 20 socket
pedestals of copper, and the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of
silver. 11 Also, for the north side, there were 100 cubits of hanging
curtains. Their 20 pillars and their 20 socket pedestals were of copper. The
hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver. 12 But for the west
side, the hanging curtains were for 50 cubits. There were ten pillars and ten
socket pedestals, and the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of
silver. 13 The width of the east side, toward the sunrising, was 50 cubits. 14
There were 15 cubits of hanging curtains on the one wing, with three pillars
and three socket pedestals. 15 And for the other wing on the other side of the
entrance of the courtyard, there were hanging curtains for 15 cubits, with
three pillars and three socket pedestals. 16 All the hanging curtains around
the courtyard were of fine twisted linen. 17 The socket pedestals for the
pillars were of copper, the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of
silver, the tops were overlaid with silver, and there were silver fasteners
for all the pillars of the courtyard. 18 The screen of the entrance of the
courtyard was woven of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine
twisted linen. It was 20 cubits long and 5 cubits high, the same height as the
hanging curtains of the courtyard. 19 Their four pillars and their four socket
pedestals were made of copper. Their hooks and connectors were of silver, and
their tops were overlaid with silver. 20 All the tent pins for the tabernacle
and around the courtyard were of copper. 21 The following is the inventory of
the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, which was inventoried at the
command of Moses, as the responsibility of the Levites under the direction of
Ithʹa·mar the son of Aaron the priest. 22 Bezʹal·el the son of Uʹri the
son of Hur of the tribe of Judah did all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. 23
With him was O·hoʹli·ab the son of A·hisʹa·mach of the tribe of Dan, a
craftsman and an embroiderer and a weaver of the blue thread, the purple wool,
the scarlet material, and the fine linen. 24 All the gold that was used for
all the work of the holy place equaled the amount of the gold of the wave
offering, 29 talents and 730 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place.
25 And the silver of the ones registered of the assembly was 100 talents and
1,775 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place. 26 The half shekel for
each individual was half a shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place for
every man who was among those registered from 20 years of age and up,
amounting to 603,550. 27 The casting of the socket pedestals of the holy place

                                       94

Exodus 38

and the socket pedestals of the curtain amounted to 100 talents; 100 socket
pedestals equaled 100 talents, one talent for each socket pedestal. 28 From
the 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and
joined them together. 29 The copper of the offering was 70 talents and 2,400
shekels. 30 With this he made the socket pedestals of the entrance of the tent
of meeting, the copper altar and its copper grating, all the utensils of the
altar, 31 the socket pedestals around the courtyard, the socket pedestals of
the entrance of the courtyard, and all the tent pins of the tabernacle and all
the tent pins around the courtyard. |39| From the blue thread, the purple
wool, and the scarlet material, they made finely woven garments for
ministering in the holy place. They made the holy garments that were for
Aaron, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 2 He made the ephʹod of gold,
blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. 3 They
hammered plates of gold into thin sheets, and he cut it into threads to work
in with the blue thread, the purple wool, the scarlet material, and the fine
linen, and it was embroidered. 4 They made shoulder pieces for it that were
joined at its two top edges. 5 And the woven belt, which was attached to the
ephʹod for tying it securely in position, was made of the same material, of
gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, just
as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 6 Then they mounted the onyx stones in gold
settings, and they engraved them with the names of the sons of Israel, as they
would engrave a seal. 7 He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephʹod
as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as Jehovah had commanded
Moses. 8 Then he made the breastpiece with the workmanship of an embroiderer,
like the workmanship of the ephʹod, out of gold, blue thread, purple wool,
scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. 9 It was square when doubled. They
made the breastpiece, which, when doubled, was as long and as wide as the span
of the hand. 10 They set four rows of stones in it. The first row was ruby,
topaz, and emerald. 11 The second row was turquoise, sapphire, and jasper. 12
The third row was  13 And the fourth row was chrysʹo·lite, onyx, and jade.
They were mounted in settings of gold. 14 The stones corresponded to the names
of the 12 sons of Israel, and the names were engraved like a seal, each name
representing one of the 12 tribes. 15 Then they made wreathed chains on the
breastpiece, like cords of pure gold. 16 And they made two settings of gold
and two rings of gold and attached the two rings to the two corners of the
breastpiece. 17 After that they put the two cords of gold through the two
rings at the corners of the breastpiece. 18 Then they put the two ends of the
two cords through the two settings and attached them to the shoulder pieces on
the front of the ephʹod. 19 Next they made two rings of gold and set them at
the two ends on the inside edge of the breastpiece, facing the ephʹod. 20
Then they made two more rings of gold and put them on the front of the
ephʹod, below the two shoulder pieces, close to where it is joined, above the
woven belt of the ephʹod. 21 Finally, they tied the breastpiece with a blue
cord from its rings to the rings of the ephʹod, in order to keep the
breastpiece in its place on the ephʹod, above the woven belt, just as Jehovah
had commanded Moses. 22 Then he made the sleeveless coat of the ephʹod, woven
by a loom worker, all of blue thread. 23 The opening of the sleeveless coat
was in the middle of it, like the opening of a coat of mail. Its opening had a
border around it, so that it would not be torn. 24 Next they made on the hem
of the sleeveless coat pomegranates of blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet
material, twisted together. 25 And they made bells of pure gold and put the
bells in between the pomegranates all around the hem of the sleeveless coat,

                                       95

Exodus 39

in between the pomegranates; 26 they alternated a bell and a pomegranate, a
bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the sleeveless coat, which was
used for ministering, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 27 And they made
the robes of fine linen, woven by a loom worker, for Aaron and his sons, 28
and the turban of fine linen, the ornamental headgear of fine linen, the linen
shorts of fine twisted linen, 29 and the sash of fine twisted linen, blue
thread, purple wool, and scarlet material woven together, just as Jehovah had
commanded Moses. 30 Finally, they made the shining plate, the holy sign of
dedication, out of pure gold and inscribed on it an inscription as one would
engrave a seal: “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.“ 31 They attached to it a
cord made from blue thread in order to put it on the turban, just as Jehovah
had commanded Moses. 32 So all the work for the tabernacle, the tent of
meeting, was completed, and the Israelites did everything that Jehovah had
commanded Moses. They did just so. 33 Then they brought the tabernacle to
Moses, the tent and all its equipment: its clasps, its panel frames, its bars
and its pillars and its socket pedestals; 34 its covering of ram skins dyed
red, its covering of sealskins, the curtain for the screen; 35 the ark of the
Testimony and its poles and the cover; 36 the table, all its utensils and the
showbread; 37 the lampstand of pure gold, its lamps, the row of lamps, and all
its utensils and the oil for lighting; 38 the altar of gold, the anointing
oil, the perfumed incense, the screen for the entrance of the tent; 39 the
altar of copper and its grating of copper, its poles, all its utensils, the
basin and its stand; 40 the hanging curtains of the courtyard, its pillars and
its socket pedestals, the screen for the entrance of the courtyard, its tent
cords and its tent pins and all the utensils for the service of the
tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 41 the finely woven garments for
ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the
garments of his sons for serving as priests. 42 According to all that Jehovah
had commanded Moses, that was how the Israelites did all the work. 43 When
Moses inspected all their work, he saw that they had done it just as Jehovah
had commanded; and Moses blessed them. |40| Then Jehovah said to Moses: 2
“On the first day of the first month, you are to set up the tabernacle, the
tent of meeting. 3 Place the ark of the Testimony in it, and screen off the
Ark with the curtain. 4 You are to bring the table in and arrange the things
that belong on it and bring in the lampstand and light its lamps. 5 Then put
the golden altar for incense before the ark of the Testimony and put the
screen for the entrance of the tabernacle in place. 6 “You are to put the
altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle, the tent of
meeting, 7 and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and
put water in it. 8 Then set up the courtyard around it and put up the screen
for the entrance of the courtyard. 9 Next you are to take the anointing oil
and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and sanctify it and all its
utensils, so that it will become something holy. 10 You are to anoint the
altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and sanctify the altar, so that
it will become a most holy altar. 11 And anoint the basin and its stand and
sanctify it. 12 “Then bring Aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the
tent of meeting, and wash them with water. 13 And you are to clothe Aaron with
the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him, and he will serve as priest
to me. 14 After that bring his sons near, and clothe them with robes. 15 You
are to anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they will serve
as priests to me, and their anointing will serve continually for them as a
lasting priesthood during their generations.“ 16 Moses did according to all

                                       96

Exodus 40

that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so. 17 In the first month, in the
second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up. 18 When
Moses set up the tabernacle, he put its socket pedestals down, set up the
panel frames, put its bars in, and set up its pillars. 19 He spread out the
tent over the tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent over it, just as
Jehovah had commanded Moses. 20 After that he took the Testimony and put it
into the Ark and placed the poles on the Ark and put the cover on the Ark. 21
He brought the Ark into the tabernacle and put the curtain of the screen in
place and screened off the ark of the Testimony, just as Jehovah had commanded
Moses. 22 Next he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of
the tabernacle outside the curtain, 23 and he arranged the row of bread on it
before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 24 He placed the
lampstand in the tent of meeting in front of the table, on the south side of
the tabernacle. 25 He lit the lamps before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had
commanded Moses. 26 He next placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting
before the curtain, 27 in order to make perfumed incense smoke on it, just as
Jehovah had commanded Moses. 28 Then he put the screen for the entrance of the
tabernacle in place. 29 He placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance
of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, so that he might offer up the burnt
offering and the grain offering on it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 30
He then placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put
water in it for washing. 31 Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands
and their feet at it. 32 Whenever they went into the tent of meeting or
approached the altar, they would wash, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 33
Finally he set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar and put up
the screen for the entrance of the courtyard.
So Moses finished the work. 34
And the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting, and Jehovah’s glory filled
the tabernacle. 35 Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting because
the cloud remained over it, and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle. 36
And when the cloud lifted from the tabernacle, the Israelites would break camp
during all stages of their journey. 37 However, if the cloud did not lift up,
then they would not break camp until the day it lifted. 38 For Jehovah’s
cloud was over the tabernacle by day, and a fire remained over it by night in
the sight of all the house of Israel during all stages of their journey. 


Leviticus

|1| And Jehovah called Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting,
saying: 2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘If any one of you would
present an offering to Jehovah from the domestic animals, you should present
your offering from the herd or from the flock. 3 “‘If his offering is a
burnt offering from the herd, he should present a sound male animal. He should
present it of his own free will before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of
meeting. 4 He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it
will be accepted in his behalf to make atonement for him. 5 “‘Then the
young bull must be slaughtered before Jehovah, and the sons of Aaron, the
priests, will present the blood and sprinkle the blood on all sides of the
altar, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 6 The burnt offering
should be skinned and cut into pieces. 7 The sons of Aaron, the priests, are
to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 8 The sons of Aaron,
the priests, will arrange the pieces of the offering with the head and the
suet over the wood that is on the fire on the altar. 9 Its intestines and its
shanks will be washed with water, and the priest is to make all of it smoke on
the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to
Jehovah. 10 “‘If his offering for a burnt offering is from the flock, from
the young rams or the goats, he should present a sound male. 11 It is to be

                                       97

Leviticus 1

slaughtered at the north side of the altar before Jehovah, and the sons of
Aaron, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar. 12 He
will cut it up into pieces, and with its head and its suet, the priest will
arrange them over the wood on the fire on the altar. 13 He will wash the
intestines and the shanks with water, and the priest will present all of it
and make it smoke on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by
fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 14 “‘However, if he offers birds as a
burnt offering to Jehovah, he will present his offering from the turtledoves
or the young pigeons. 15 The priest will present it at the altar and nip off
its head and make it smoke on the altar, but its blood should be drained out
on the side of the altar. 16 He should remove its crop and its feathers and
throw them beside the altar, to the east, to the place for the ashes. 17 He
will split it at its wings without dividing it into two parts. Then the priest
will make it smoke on the altar over the wood that is on the fire. It is a
burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. |2|
“‘Now if someone presents a grain offering to Jehovah, his offering must
be fine flour, and he should pour oil on it and put frankincense on it. 2 Then
he will bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests, and the priest will take a
handful of the fine flour and oil and all its frankincense, and he will make
it smoke as a token offering on the altar, an offering made by fire of a
pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 3 Whatever is left of the grain offering belongs to
Aaron and his sons as something most holy from Jehovah’s offerings made by
fire. 4 “‘If you present a grain offering that has been baked in the oven,
it should be of fine flour, unleavened ring-shaped loaves mixed with oil or
unleavened wafers spread with oil. 5 “‘If your offering is a grain
offering from the griddle, it should be of fine, unleavened flour mixed with
oil. 6 It should be broken into pieces, and you are to pour oil on it. It is a
grain offering. 7 “‘If your offering is a grain offering prepared in a
pan, it should be made of fine flour with oil. 8 You should bring the grain
offering that was made of these to Jehovah, and it will be presented to the
priest, who will bring it near to the altar. 9 And the priest will lift off
some of the grain offering as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar
as an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 10 What is left of
the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons as something most holy of
Jehovah’s offerings by fire. 11 “‘No grain offering that you present to
Jehovah should be leavened, for you must not make any sourdough or honey smoke
as an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 12 “‘You may present them to
Jehovah as an offering of the firstfruits, but they must not be brought to the
altar as a pleasing aroma. 13 “‘Every grain offering you make is to be
seasoned with salt; and you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your
God to be missing from your grain offering. Along with every offering of
yours, you will present salt. 14 “‘If you present the grain offering of
the first ripe fruits to Jehovah, you should present new grain roasted with
fire, coarsely crushed new kernels, as the grain offering of your first ripe
fruits. 15 You are to put oil on it and place frankincense on it. It is a
grain offering. 16 The priest will make it smoke as a token offering, that is,
some of the coarse grain and oil along with all its frankincense, as an
offering made by fire to Jehovah. |3| “‘If his offering is a communion
sacrifice and if he is presenting it from the herd, whether a male or a
female, he should present a sound animal before Jehovah. 2 He is to lay his
hand on the head of his offering, and it will be slaughtered at the entrance
of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, will sprinkle the

Leviticus 3

blood on all sides of the altar. 3 He will present part of the communion
sacrifice as an offering made by fire to Jehovah: the fat that covers the
intestines, all the fat that surrounds the intestines, 4 and the two kidneys
with the fat on them that is near the loins. He will also remove the appendage
of the liver along with the kidneys. 5 Aaron’s sons will make it smoke on
the altar on top of the burnt offering that is placed on the wood that is over
the fire; it is an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 6
“‘If his offering is from the flock for a communion sacrifice to Jehovah,
he will present a sound male or a female animal. 7 If he is presenting a young
ram as his offering, then he will present it before Jehovah. 8 He will lay his
hand on the head of his offering, and it will be slaughtered in front of the
tent of meeting. Aaron’s sons will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the
altar. 9 He will present the fat from the communion sacrifice as an offering
made by fire to Jehovah. He will remove the entire fat tail near the backbone,
the fat that covers the intestines, all the fat that surrounds the intestines,
10 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins. He will
also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 11 And the
priest will make it smoke on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to
Jehovah. 12 “‘If his offering is a goat, then he will present it before
Jehovah. 13 He will lay his hand on its head, and it will be slaughtered
before the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons must sprinkle its blood on all
sides of the altar. 14 The part he will present as his offering made by fire
to Jehovah is the fat that covers the intestines, all the fat that surrounds
the intestines, 15 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the
loins. He will also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 
16 The priest will make them smoke on the altar as food, an offering made by
fire for a pleasing aroma. All the fat belongs to Jehovah. 17 “‘It is a
lasting statute for your generations, in all your dwelling places: You must
not eat any fat or any blood at all.’“ |4| Jehovah went on to say to
Moses: 2 “Tell the Israelites, ‘If someone sins unintentionally by doing
any of the things that Jehovah commanded should not be done: 3 “‘If the
anointed priest sins and brings guilt on the people, then he must present a
sound young bull to Jehovah as a sin offering for the sin he committed. 4 He
will bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah and
lay his hand on the bull’s head, and he is to slaughter the bull before
Jehovah. 5 Then the anointed priest will take some of the bull’s blood and
bring it into the tent of meeting; 6 and the priest will dip his finger in the
blood and spatter some of the blood seven times before Jehovah in front of the
curtain of the holy place. 7 The priest will also put some of the blood on the
horns of the altar of perfumed incense, which is before Jehovah in the tent of
meeting; and he will pour all the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of
the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 
8 “‘He will then remove all the fat of the bull of the sin offering,
including the fat that covers the intestines and the fat that surrounds the
intestines, 9 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins.
And he will remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 10 It
will be the same as what is removed from a bull of the communion sacrifice.
And the priest will make them smoke on the altar of burnt offering. 11
“‘But as for the skin of the bull and all its flesh along with its head,
its shanks, its intestines, and its dung— 12 all the rest of the bull—he
will have it taken to the outskirts of the camp to a clean place where the
ashes are discarded, and he will burn it on wood in the fire. It should be

Leviticus 4

burned where the ashes are discarded. 13 “‘Now if the entire assembly of
Israel has become guilty by committing a sin unintentionally, but the
congregation was unaware that they had done something that Jehovah commanded
them not to do, 14 and then the sin becomes known, the congregation must
present a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of
meeting. 15 The elders of the assembly will lay their hands on the bull’s
head before Jehovah, and the bull will be slaughtered before Jehovah. 16
“‘Then the anointed priest will bring some of the bull’s blood into the
tent of meeting. 17 The priest is to dip his finger into the blood and spatter
some of it seven times before Jehovah in front of the curtain. 18 He will then
put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before Jehovah, which
is in the tent of meeting; and he will pour all the rest of the blood at the
base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of
meeting. 19 He will remove all its fat and make it smoke on the altar. 20 He
is to do to the bull just as he did to the other bull of the sin offering.
That is how he will do it, and the priest will make atonement for them, and
they will be forgiven. 21 He will have the bull taken to the outskirts of the
camp and will burn it, just as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering
for the congregation. 22 “‘When a chieftain unintentionally sins by doing
one of all the things that Jehovah his God commands should not be done and has
become guilty, 23 or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has committed
against the commandment, then he must bring a sound young male goat as his
offering. 24 He will lay his hand on the head of the young goat and slaughter
it in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before Jehovah. It is
a sin offering. 25 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering
with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he
will pour the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. 26
He will make all its fat smoke on the altar like the fat of the communion
sacrifice; and the priest will make atonement for him for his sin, and it will
be forgiven him. 27 “‘If any one of the people of the land sins
unintentionally and becomes guilty by doing one of the things that Jehovah
commands should not be done, 28 or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has
committed, then he should bring a sound young female goat as his offering for
the sin he has committed. 29 He will lay his hand on the head of the sin
offering and slaughter the sin offering in the same place as the burnt
offering. 30 The priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it
on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he will pour all the rest of
its blood at the base of the altar. 31 He will remove all its fat, just as the
fat is removed from the communion sacrifice, and the priest will make it smoke
on the altar as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah; and the priest will make
atonement for him, and it will be forgiven him. 32 “‘But if he offers a
lamb as his sin offering, he should bring a sound female lamb. 33 He will lay
his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering in
the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. 34 The priest will take
some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns
of the altar of burnt offering, and he will pour all the rest of its blood at
the base of the altar. 35 He will remove all its fat the same way that the fat
of the young ram of the communion sacrifice is removed, and the priest will
make them smoke on the altar on top of Jehovah’s offerings made by fire; and
the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and
it will be forgiven him. |5| “‘If someone sins because he has heard a
public call to testify and he is a witness or has seen or learned about it and

he does not report it, then he will answer for his error. 2 “‘Or when a
person touches anything unclean, whether the dead body of an unclean wild
animal, an unclean domestic animal, or an unclean swarming creature, he is
unclean and has become guilty even if he does not realize it. 3 Or in case
someone without being aware of it touches human uncleanness—anything unclean
that may make him unclean—and he comes to know it, then he becomes guilty. 4
“‘Or if someone rashly swears to do something—whether it is to do good
or to do evil, no matter what it may be—and he was unaware of it, but then
he realizes that he has sworn rashly, he becomes guilty. 5 “‘If he becomes
guilty as respects one of these things, then he must confess in what way he
has sinned. 6 He will also bring his guilt offering to Jehovah for the sin
that he committed, namely, a female from the flock, either a female lamb or a
young female goat, for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement for
him for his sin. 7 “‘If, though, he cannot afford a sheep, he must bring
to Jehovah two turtledoves or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for the
sin, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering. 8 He is to bring
them to the priest, who will present first the one for the sin offering and
nip off its head at the front of its neck, without severing it. 9 He will
spatter some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, but
the remainder of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar. It is
a sin offering. 10 He will handle the other one as a burnt offering according
to the regular procedure; and the priest will make atonement for him for the
sin that he has committed, and it will be forgiven him. 11 “‘Now if he
cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he must bring as his
offering for his sin a tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour for a sin offering.
He should not add oil to it or place frankincense on it, for it is a sin
offering. 12 He will bring it to the priest, and the priest will take from it
his handful as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar on top of
Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. It is a sin offering. 13 The priest will
make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, any one of these
sins, and it will be forgiven him. The remainder of the offering will become
the priest’s, just like the grain offering.’“ 14 Jehovah continued to
speak to Moses, saying: 15 “If someone behaves unfaithfully by
unintentionally sinning against the holy things of Jehovah, he is to bring to
Jehovah a sound ram from the flock as a guilt offering; its value in silver
shekels is set according to the standard shekel of the holy place. 16 And he
will make compensation for the sin he has committed against the holy place and
he will also add a fifth of its value. He will give it to the priest, so that
the priest may make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and
it will be forgiven him. 17 “If someone sins by doing any of the things that
Jehovah commands should not be done, even if he is not aware of it, he is
still guilty and will answer for his error. 18 He should bring to the priest a
sound ram from the flock according to the estimated value, for a guilt
offering. Then the priest will make atonement for him for the unintentional
mistake that he unknowingly committed, and it will be forgiven him. 19 It is a
guilt offering. He has certainly become guilty of sinning against Jehovah.“ 
|6| Jehovah went on to say to Moses: 2 “If someone sins and behaves
unfaithfully toward Jehovah by deceiving his neighbor in connection with
something entrusted to him, or something deposited with him, or he robs or
defrauds his neighbor, 3 or he finds something lost and is deceptive about it,
and if he swears falsely over any such sin he may commit, this is what he
should do: 4 If he has sinned and is guilty, he must return what he stole,

                                       101

Leviticus 6

what he extorted, what he took by fraud, what was entrusted to him, or the
lost thing that he found, 5 or anything about which he swore falsely, and he
must make full compensation for it, and he will add to it a fifth of its
value. He will give it to the owner on the day his guilt is proved. 6 And he
will bring to the priest as his guilt offering to Jehovah a sound ram from the
flock according to the assessed value, for a guilt offering. 7 The priest will
make atonement for him before Jehovah, and he will be forgiven for anything he
may have done resulting in his guilt.“ 8 Jehovah continued to speak to
Moses, saying: 9 “Command Aaron and his sons and say, ‘This is the law of
the burnt offering: The burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar
all night long until the morning, and the fire will be kept burning on the
altar. 10 The priest will clothe himself with his official dress of linen, and
he will put the linen shorts on over his flesh. Then he will remove the ashes
of the burnt offering that the fire had consumed on the altar and place them
beside the altar. 11 Then he will take off his garments and put on other
garments and take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp. 12 The fire
will be kept burning on the altar. It must not go out. The priest must burn
wood on it each morning and arrange the burnt offering over it, and he will
make the fat of the communion sacrifices smoke over it. 13 Fire will be kept
constantly burning on the altar. It must not go out. 14 “‘Now this is the
law of the grain offering: You sons of Aaron are to present it before Jehovah
in front of the altar. 15 One of them will take a handful from the fine flour
of the grain offering and some of its oil and all the frankincense that is on
the grain offering, and he will make it smoke on the altar as a pleasing aroma
for a token offering to Jehovah. 16 Aaron and his sons will eat what is left
of it. It will be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place. They will eat it
in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 17 It should not be baked with
anything leavened. I have given it as their share out of my offerings made by
fire. It is something most holy, like the sin offering and like the guilt
offering. 18 Every male among the sons of Aaron will eat it. It is their
permanent allowance throughout your generations from Jehovah’s offerings
made by fire. Everything that touches them will become holy.’“ 19 Jehovah
spoke again to Moses: 20 “This is the offering that Aaron and his sons will
present to Jehovah on the day he is anointed: the tenth of an eʹphah of fine
flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in
the evening. 21 It will be made with oil on a griddle. You will bring it
well-mixed with oil and present it in pieces as a baked product of the grain
offering as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 22 The anointed priest who succeeds
him from among his sons will make it. It is a lasting regulation: As a whole
offering it will be made to smoke to Jehovah. 23 Every grain offering of a
priest should be a whole offering. It must not be eaten.“ 24 Jehovah spoke
again to Moses and said: 25 “Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is the law of
the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the
sin offering will also be slaughtered before Jehovah. It is a most holy thing.
26 The priest who offers it for sin will eat it. It will be eaten in a holy
place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 27 “‘Everything that
touches its flesh will become holy, and when anyone spatters some of its blood
on his garment, you should wash what was spattered with blood in a holy place.
28 The earthenware vessel in which it was boiled is to be shattered. But if it
was boiled in a copper vessel, then the vessel must be scoured and washed with
water. 29 “‘Every male among the priests will eat it. It is something most
holy. 30 However, no sin offering is to be eaten if some of its blood is

Leviticus 6

brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place. It is to
be burned with fire. |7| “‘This is the law of the guilt offering: It is
something most holy. 2 They will slaughter the guilt offering in the place
where they slaughter the burnt offerings, and its blood should be sprinkled on
all sides of the altar. 3 He will present all its fat, including the fat tail,
the fat that covers the intestines, 4 and the two kidneys with their fat that
is near the loins. He will also remove the appendage of the liver along with
the kidneys. 5 The priest will make them smoke on the altar as an offering
made by fire to Jehovah. It is a guilt offering. 6 Every male among the
priests will eat it, and it should be eaten in a holy place. It is something
most holy. 7 The law regarding the sin offering applies to the guilt offering;
it belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it. 8 “‘When the priest
presents the burnt offering for someone, the skin of the burnt offering that
was presented to the priest will become his. 9 “‘Every grain offering that
is baked in the oven or prepared in the pan or on the griddle belongs to the
priest who presents it. It will become his. 10 But every grain offering that
is mixed with oil or that is dry will be for all of Aaron’s sons; each will
have an equal share. 11 “‘Now this is the law of the communion sacrifice
that one may present to Jehovah: 12 If he presents it as an expression of
thanksgiving, he will present along with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened
ring-shaped loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and
ring-shaped loaves made with fine flour, well-mixed and blended with oil. 13
He will present his offering along with ring-shaped loaves of leavened bread
and the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices. 14 He is to
present from it one of each offering as a sacred portion to Jehovah; it will
belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the communion sacrifices. 15
The flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices is to be
eaten on the day he offers it. He must not save any of it until morning. 16
“‘If the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it is
to be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, and what is left of it may
also be eaten on the next day. 17 But whatever is left of the flesh of the
sacrifice on the third day is to be burned with fire. 18 However, if any of
the flesh of his communion sacrifice is eaten on the third day, the one
presenting it will not be accepted with approval. It will not be credited to
him; it is an offensive thing, and the person who eats some of it will answer
for his error. 19 Flesh that touches anything unclean is not to be eaten. It
is to be burned with fire. Everyone who is clean may eat the clean flesh. 20
“‘But any person who is unclean and eats the flesh of the communion
sacrifice, which is for Jehovah, that person must be cut off from his people. 
21 If someone touches anything unclean, whether the uncleanness of a man or an
unclean animal or any unclean disgusting thing, and eats some of the flesh of
the communion sacrifice, which is for Jehovah, that person must be cut off
from his people.’“ 22 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 23
“Tell the Israelites, ‘You must not eat any fat of a bull or a young ram
or a goat. 24 The fat of an animal found dead and the fat of an animal killed
by another animal may be used for any other purpose, but you must never eat
it. 25 For whoever eats fat from an animal that he presents as an offering
made by fire to Jehovah must be cut off from his people. 26 “‘You must not
eat any blood in any of your dwelling places, whether that of birds or that of
animals. 27 Anyone who eats any blood must be cut off from his people.’“ 
28 Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying: 29 “Tell the Israelites,
‘Whoever presents his communion sacrifice to Jehovah will bring part of the

offering from his communion sacrifice to Jehovah. 30 He will bring in his own
hands the fat along with the breast as an offering made by fire to Jehovah,
and he will wave it back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 31 The
priest will make the fat smoke on the altar, but the breast will belong to
Aaron and his sons. 32 “‘You will give the right leg as a sacred portion
to the priest from your communion sacrifices. 33 The son of Aaron who presents
the blood of the communion sacrifices and the fat will have the right leg as
his portion. 34 For I take the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the
sacred portion from the communion sacrifices of the Israelites, and I give
them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a lasting regulation for the
Israelites. 35 “‘This was the portion from Jehovah’s offerings made by
fire to be set aside for the priests, for Aaron and his sons, on the day he
presented them to serve as priests to Jehovah. 36 Jehovah commanded to give
them this portion from the Israelites on the day he anointed them. It is a
permanent statute for their generations.’“ 37 This is the law concerning
the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering,
the installation sacrifice, and the communion sacrifice, 38 just as Jehovah
commanded Moses on Mount Siʹnai in the day he commanded the Israelites to
present their offerings to Jehovah in the wilderness of Siʹnai. |8| Jehovah
continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him,
the garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams,
and the basket of unleavened bread, 3 and make all the assembly gather
together at the entrance of the tent of meeting.“ 4 Then Moses did just as
Jehovah had commanded him, and the assembly gathered together at the entrance
of the tent of meeting. 5 Moses now said to the assembly: “This is what
Jehovah has commanded us to do.“ 6 So Moses brought Aaron and his sons near
and washed them with water. 7 After that he put the robe on him, wrapped him
with the sash, clothed him with the sleeveless coat, and put the ephʹod on
him and tied it with the woven belt of the ephʹod, binding it securely on
him. 8 Next he placed the breastpiece on him and put the Uʹrim and the
Thumʹmim in the breastpiece. 9 Then he placed the turban on his head, and he
put on the front of the turban the shining plate of gold, the holy sign of
dedication, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 10 Moses then took the
anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and
sanctified them. 11 After that he spattered some of it seven times on the
altar and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand
in order to sanctify them. 12 Finally he poured some of the anointing oil on
Aaron’s head and anointed him in order to sanctify him. 13 Moses then
brought Aaron’s sons near and clothed them with robes and wrapped them with
sashes and put headgear on them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 14 Then
he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their
hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 15 Moses slaughtered it and
took the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar on all
sides, and he purified the altar from sin, but the rest of the blood he poured
at the base of the altar, in order to sanctify it to make atonement on it. 16
After that he took all the fat that was on the intestines, the appendage of
the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses made them smoke on the
altar. 17 Then he had the rest of the bull, its skin, its flesh, and its dung,
burned with fire outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 18 He
now brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons laid
their hands on the head of the ram. 19 Moses then slaughtered it and sprinkled
the blood on all sides of the altar. 20 He cut the ram into its pieces, and

                                       104

Leviticus 8

Moses made the head, the pieces, and the suet smoke. 21 He washed the
intestines and the shanks with water, and Moses made the entire ram smoke on
the altar. It was a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma. It was an offering
made by fire to Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 22 Then he
brought the second ram, the ram of the installation, and Aaron and his sons
laid their hands on the ram’s head. 23 Moses slaughtered it and took some of
its blood and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe and on the thumb of his right
hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 24 Next Moses brought Aaron’s
sons forward and put some of the blood on their right earlobe and on the thumb
of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot; but Moses
sprinkled the rest of the blood on all sides of the altar. 25 Then he took the
fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the intestines, the appendage of
the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right leg. 26 He took out of
the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah one unleavened
ring-shaped loaf, one ring-shaped loaf of oiled bread, and one wafer. He then
placed them on the pieces of fat and the right leg. 27 After that he put all
of them on the palms of Aaron and the palms of his sons and began to wave them
back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 28 Then Moses took them from
their hands and made them smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering.
They were an installation sacrifice as a pleasing aroma. It was an offering
made by fire to Jehovah. 29 Moses then took the breast and waved it back and
forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. From the installation ram it became
the portion for Moses, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 30 And Moses took
some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and
spattered it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and the garments of his
sons who were with him. Thus he sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons
and their garments. 31 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil the
flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and you will eat it there with
the bread that is in the installation basket, just as I was commanded,
‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’ 32 What is left over of the flesh and
the bread you will burn with fire. 33 You must not go out from the entrance of
the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days for completing your
installation are over, because it will take seven days to install you as
priests. 34 Jehovah commanded that we do what we have done today in order to
make atonement for you. 35 You will stay at the entrance of the tent of
meeting day and night for seven days and carry out your obligation to Jehovah,
so that you may not die; for so I have been commanded.“ 36 And Aaron and his
sons did all the things that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses. |9| On
the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. 2 He
said to Aaron: “Take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram
for a burnt offering, sound ones, and present them before Jehovah. 3 But you
will say to the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf
and a young ram, each a year old, sound ones, for a burnt offering, 4 and a
bull and a ram for communion sacrifices, to sacrifice them before Jehovah, and
a grain offering mixed with oil, for today Jehovah will appear to you.’“ 5
So they took what Moses had commanded before the tent of meeting. Then the
whole assembly came forward and stood before Jehovah. 6 And Moses said:
“This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, so that the glory of Jehovah
may appear to you.“ 7 Then Moses said to Aaron: “Approach the altar and
present your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement in your
own behalf and in behalf of your house; and present the offering of the
people, and make atonement in their behalf, just as Jehovah has commanded.“

Leviticus 9

8 Aaron immediately approached the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin
offering that was for him. 9 Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him,
and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar,
and he poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 10 He made the
fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering smoke
on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 11 And he burned the flesh
and the skin with fire outside the camp. 12 Then he slaughtered the burnt
offering, and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all
sides of the altar. 13 They handed him the pieces of the burnt offering along
with the head, and he made them smoke on the altar. 14 Further, he washed the
intestines and the shanks and made them smoke on the burnt offering on the
altar. 15 He then presented the offering of the people and took the goat of
the sin offering that was for the people and slaughtered it and made a sin
offering with it like the first one. 16 And he presented the burnt offering
and handled it according to the regular procedure. 17 He next presented the
grain offering, filling his hand with some of it and making it smoke on the
altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning. 18 After that he
slaughtered the bull and the ram of the communion sacrifice that was for the
people. Then Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around
on all sides of the altar. 19 As for the pieces of fat of the bull, the fat
tail of the ram, the fat covering the internal organs, the kidneys, and the
appendage of the liver, 20 they placed all those pieces of fat on the breasts,
after which he made the pieces of fat smoke on the altar. 21 But the breasts
and the right leg Aaron waved back and forth as a wave offering before
Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded. 22 Then Aaron raised his hands toward
the people and blessed them and came down from making the sin offering and the
burnt offering and the communion sacrifices. 23 Finally Moses and Aaron went
into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people.
Jehovah’s
glory now appeared to all the people, 24 and fire came out from Jehovah and
began consuming the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar. When
all the people saw it, they started shouting and they fell with their faces to
the ground. |10| Later Aaron’s sons Naʹdab and A·biʹhu each took his fire
holder and put fire in it and placed incense on it. Then they began offering
before Jehovah unauthorized fire, which he had not commanded them to do. 2 At
this a fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, so that they died
before Jehovah. 3 Then Moses said to Aaron: “This is what Jehovah has said,
‘I will be made holy among those near to me, and I will be glorified before
all the people.’“ And Aaron kept silent. 4 So Moses called Mishʹa·el and
El·zaʹphan, the sons of Uzʹzi·el, Aaron’s uncle, and said to them:
“Come here, carry your brothers from in front of the holy place to a place
outside the camp.“ 5 So they came forward and carried the men away in their
robes to a place outside the camp, just as Moses had told them. 6 Moses then
said to Aaron and his other sons El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar: “Do not let
your heads go ungroomed or tear your garments, so that you may not die and
that God may not become indignant against all the assembly. Your brothers of
the whole house of Israel will weep over those whom Jehovah has killed by the
fire. 7 You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting or you
will die, for Jehovah’s anointing oil is upon you.“ So they did according
to Moses’ word. 8 Then Jehovah said to Aaron: 9 “Do not drink wine or
other alcoholic beverages, you and your sons with you, when you come into the
tent of meeting, so that you will not die. It is a permanent statute for your
generations. 10 This is to distinguish between the holy thing and the profane

                                       106

Leviticus 10

and between the unclean thing and the clean, 11 and to teach the Israelites
all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses.“ 12 Then
Moses spoke to Aaron and to El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, his sons who were
left: “Take what was left of the grain offering from Jehovah’s offerings
made by fire and eat it as unleavened bread near the altar, because it is
something most holy. 13 You must eat it in a holy place, because it is your
allowance and the allowance of your sons from Jehovah’s offerings made by
fire, for this is what I have been commanded. 14 You will also eat the breast
of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion in a clean place, you
and your sons and your daughters with you, because these things have been
given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion
sacrifices of the Israelites. 15 They will bring the leg of the sacred portion
and the breast of the wave offering along with the offerings of fat made by
fire, in order to wave the wave offering back and forth before Jehovah; and it
will serve as a permanent allowance for you and your sons with you, just as
Jehovah has commanded.“ 16 And Moses diligently searched for the goat of the
sin offering, and he discovered that it had been burned up. So he grew
indignant at El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, Aaron’s sons who were left, and
he said: 17 “Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place, since
it is something most holy and he has given it to you so that you may answer
for the error of the assembly and make atonement for them before Jehovah? 18
Look! Its blood has not been brought inside the holy place. You certainly
should have eaten it in the holy place, just as I was commanded.“ 19 Aaron
replied to Moses: “Look! Today they presented their sin offering and their
burnt offering before Jehovah, and yet these things happened to me. If I had
eaten the sin offering today, would that have been pleasing to Jehovah?“ 20
When Moses heard that, he was satisfied. |11| Then Jehovah said to Moses and
Aaron: 2 “Tell the Israelites, ‘These are the living creatures of the
earth that you may eat: 3 Every animal that has a split hoof and a cleft in
its hooves and that chews the cud may be eaten. 4 “‘But you must not eat
these animals that chew the cud or have a split hoof: the camel, which chews
the cud but does not have a split hoof. It is unclean for you. 5 Also the rock
badger, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. It is unclean
for you. 6 Also the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have a split
hoof. It is unclean for you. 7 Also the pig, because it has a split hoof and a
cleft in the hoof but does not chew the cud. It is unclean for you. 8 You must
not eat any of their flesh or touch their dead body. They are unclean for you.
9 “‘This is what you may eat of everything in the waters: Anything in the
waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, it you
may eat. 10 But anything in the seas and in the rivers that has no fins and
scales, among all the swarming creatures and of every other living creature
that is in the waters, it is a loathsome thing for you. 11 Yes, they should be
loathsome to you, and you must not eat any of their flesh and you must loathe
their carcasses. 12 Everything in the waters that has no fins and scales is a
loathsome thing to you. 13 “‘These are the flying creatures that you are
to loathe; they should not be eaten, for they are loathsome: the eagle, the
osprey, the black vulture, 14 the red kite and every kind of black kite, 15
every kind of raven, 16 the ostrich, the owl, the gull, every kind of falcon, 
17 the little owl, the cormorant, the long-eared owl, 18 the swan, the
pelican, the vulture, 19 the stork, every kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the

loathsome to you. 21 “‘Of the winged swarming creatures that move on all

fours, you may eat only those that have jointed legs above their feet for
leaping on the ground. 22 Of these you may eat: various kinds of migratory
locusts, other edible locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers. 23 All other winged
swarming creatures with four legs are something loathsome to you. 24 By these
you would make yourselves unclean. Everyone touching their dead bodies will be
unclean until the evening. 25 Anyone carrying any of their dead bodies should
wash his garments; he will be unclean until the evening. 26 “‘Any animal
that has a split hoof but does not have a cleft and does not chew its cud is
unclean to you. Everyone touching them will be unclean. 27 Every living
creature that walks on paws among the creatures that walk on all fours is
unclean to you. Everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the
evening. 28 The one who carries their dead bodies should wash his garments,
and he will be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you. 29
“‘These are the swarming creatures of the earth that are unclean to you:
the mole rat, the mouse, every kind of lizard, 30 the gecko, the large lizard,
the newt, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. 31 These swarming creatures are
unclean to you. Everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the
evening. 32 “‘Now anything they fall on when they die will be unclean,
whether a wooden utensil, a garment, a skin, or a piece of sackcloth. Any
utensil that is used should be immersed in water, and it will be unclean until
the evening; then it will be clean. 33 If they fall into an earthenware
vessel, you are to smash it, and anything that was in it will be unclean. 34
Any kind of food that comes in contact with water from such a vessel will be
unclean, and any drinkable liquid in such a vessel will be unclean. 35
Anything their dead bodies fall on will be unclean. Whether oven or small
stove, it should be broken into pieces. They are unclean, and they will remain
unclean to you. 36 Only a spring and a cistern for storing water will continue
clean, but anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean. 37 If their dead
bodies fall on a plant seed that is to be sown, it is clean. 38 But if water
is put on a seed and part of their dead body falls on it, the seed is unclean
to you. 39 “‘Now if an animal that you use for food dies, whoever touches
its dead body will be unclean until the evening. 40 Whoever eats any of its
dead body should wash his garments, and he will be unclean until the evening.
Whoever carries off its dead body should wash his garments, and he will be
unclean until the evening. 41 Every swarming creature of the earth is
something loathsome. It must not be eaten. 42 You must not eat any creature
that crawls on its belly, any creature that goes on all fours, or any of
earth’s swarming creatures with a great number of legs, for they are
something loathsome. 43 Do not make yourselves loathsome by means of any
swarming creature, and do not defile yourselves and become unclean by them. 44
For I am Jehovah your God, and you must sanctify yourselves and become holy,
because I am holy. So you must not make yourselves unclean by any swarming
creature that moves on the earth. 45 For I am Jehovah, who is leading you up
out of the land of Egypt to prove myself God to you, and you must be holy,
because I am holy. 46 “‘This is the law about the animals, the flying
creatures, every living creature that moves through the waters, and concerning
every creature that swarms on the earth, 47 in order to make a distinction
between the unclean and the clean and between the living creatures that may be
eaten and those that may not be eaten.’“ |12| Jehovah went on to say to
Moses: 2 “Tell the Israelites, ‘If a woman becomes pregnant and gives
birth to a male, she will be unclean for seven days, just as she is in the
days of the impurity when she is menstruating. 3 On the eighth day, the flesh

                                       108

of his foreskin will be circumcised. 4 She will continue cleansing herself
from the blood for the next 33 days. She should not touch any holy thing, and
she should not come into the holy place until she fulfills the days of her
purification. 5 “‘If she should give birth to a female, she will then be
unclean for 14 days, just as she would be during her menstruation. She will
continue cleansing herself from the blood for the next 66 days. 6 When the
days of her purification for a son or a daughter are completed, she will bring
a young ram in its first year for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a
turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the
priest. 7 He will present it before Jehovah and make atonement for her, and
she will be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law about the woman who
gives birth to either a male or a female. 8 But if she cannot afford a sheep,
she must then take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt
offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest will make atonement for
her, and she will be clean.’“ |13| Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and
Aaron, saying: 2 “If a man develops on his skin a swelling, a scab, or a
blotch and it could become the disease of leprosy on his skin, he must then be
brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests. 3 The priest
will examine the infection on his skin. When the hair in the infection has
turned white and the appearance of the infection is deeper than the skin, it
is the disease of leprosy. The priest will examine it and declare him unclean.
4 But if the blotch on his skin is white and its appearance is not deeper than
the skin and the hair has not turned white, the priest will then quarantine
the infected person for seven days. 5 The priest will then examine him on the
seventh day, and if it appears that the infection has stopped and has not
spread on the skin, the priest will quarantine him for another seven days. 6
“The priest should examine him again on the seventh day, and if the
infection has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest will declare
him clean; it was only a scab. The man will then wash his garments and be
clean. 7 But if the scab has definitely spread on the skin after he appears
before the priest to establish his purification, he will then appear again
before the priest. 8 The priest will examine it, and if the scab has spread in
the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is leprosy. 9 “If the
disease of leprosy develops in a man, he must then be brought to the priest, 
10 and the priest will examine him. If there is a white swelling on the skin
and it has turned the hair white and there is an open sore in the swelling, 11
it is chronic leprosy on his skin, and the priest will declare him unclean. He
should not quarantine him, for he is unclean. 12 Now if the leprosy breaks out
all over the skin and the leprosy covers the person with the disease from head
to foot, as far as the priest can see, 13 and the priest has examined him and
sees that the leprosy has covered all his skin, he will then declare the
infected person clean. All of it has turned white, and he is clean. 14 But
whenever an open sore appears in it, he will be unclean. 15 When the priest
sees the open sore, he will declare him unclean. The open sore is unclean. It
is leprosy. 16 But if the open sore again turns white, he will then come to
the priest. 17 The priest will examine him, and if the infection has turned
white, the priest will then declare the infected person clean. He is clean. 18
“If a person develops a boil on his skin and it heals, 19 but in the place
of the boil a white swelling or a reddish-white blotch has developed, he must
then show himself to the priest. 20 The priest will examine it, and if it
appears to be deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest
will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy that has broken

                                       109

out in the boil. 21 But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no
white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and appears faded, the
priest will then quarantine him for seven days. 22 And if it has clearly
spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is a disease.
23 But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread, it is only the
inflammation from the boil, and the priest will declare him clean. 24 “Or if
someone has a scar from the fire and the raw flesh of the scar becomes a
reddish-white blotch or a white one, 25 the priest will then examine it. If
the hair in the blotch has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the
skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the scar, and the priest will
declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy. 26 But if the priest
examines it and sees that there is no white hair in the blotch and it is not
deeper than the skin and it is faded, the priest will then quarantine him for
seven days. 27 The priest will examine him on the seventh day, and if it has
clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is
the disease of leprosy. 28 But if the blotch stays in one place and has not
spread over the skin and it is faded, it is only a swelling of the scar, and
the priest will declare him clean, because it is an inflammation of the scar. 
29 “When a man or a woman develops an infection on the head or on the chin, 
30 the priest will then examine the infection. If it appears to be deeper than
the skin and the hair is yellow and thin, the priest will then declare such
one unclean; it is an infection of the scalp or the beard. It is leprosy of
the head or of the chin. 31 But if the priest sees that the infection does not
appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest
should quarantine the infected person for seven days. 32 The priest will
examine the infection on the seventh day, and if the infected area has not
spread and no yellow hair has developed in it and the appearance of the
infected area is not deeper than the skin, 33 the person should have himself
shaved, but he will not have the infected area shaved. Then the priest will
quarantine the infected person for seven days. 34 “The priest will again
examine the infected area on the seventh day, and if the infection of the
scalp and beard has not spread on the skin and it does not appear deeper than
the skin, the priest must then declare him clean, and he should wash his
garments and be clean. 35 But if the infection clearly spreads on the skin
after his purification, 36 the priest will examine him, and if the infection
has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; that
person is unclean. 37 But if the examination shows that the infection has not
spread and black hair has grown on it, the infection has been healed. He is
clean, and the priest will declare him clean. 38 “If a man or a woman
develops blotches on the skin and the blotches are white, 39 the priest will
examine them. If the skin blotches are faded white, it is a harmless rash that
has broken out on the skin. That person is clean. 40 “If a man loses the
hair of his head and becomes bald, he is clean. 41 If he loses the hair on the
front of his head and becomes bald there, he is clean. 42 But if a
reddish-white sore develops on the bald part of his scalp or on his forehead,
it is leprosy breaking out on his scalp or on his forehead. 43 The priest will
examine him, and if the swelling from the infection is reddish-white on the
bald spot on top of his head or on his forehead and it looks like leprosy on
his skin, 44 he is a leper. He is unclean, and the priest should declare him
unclean because of the disease on his head. 45 As for the leper who has the
disease, his garments should be torn and his head should be left ungroomed and
he should cover over his mustache and call out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’ 46 He

                                       110

Leviticus 13

will be unclean the whole time that he has the disease. Since he is unclean,
he should live in isolation. His dwelling place will be outside the camp. 47
“If the disease of leprosy contaminates a garment, whether a woolen or a
linen garment, 48 either in the warp or in the woof of the linen or of the
wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin, 49 and the yellowish-green or
reddish stain from the disease contaminates the garment, a skin, the warp, the
woof, or any article of skin, it is a contamination from leprosy, and it
should be shown to the priest. 50 The priest will examine the disease, and he
must quarantine the disease for seven days. 51 When he examines the disease on
the seventh day and sees that it has spread in the garment, in the warp, in
the woof, or in the skin (regardless of what the skin is used for), the
disease is malignant leprosy, and it is unclean. 52 He should burn the garment
or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen or any article of skin in
which the disease has developed, for it is malignant leprosy. It should be
burned in the fire. 53 “But if the priest examines it and the disease has
not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of
skin, 54 the priest will then command that they should wash the contaminated
item, and he will quarantine it for another seven days. 55 The priest will
then examine the contaminated item after it has been thoroughly washed. If the
appearance of the contamination has not changed, even if the disease has not
spread, it is unclean. You should burn it in the fire because it has been
eaten away, either from its underside or from its outside. 56 “But if the
priest has examined it and the contaminated part is faded after it has been
thoroughly washed, he will then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the
warp or the woof. 57 However, if it still appears in another part of the
garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is
spreading, and you should burn any contaminated item in the fire. 58 But when
the contamination disappears from the garment or the warp or the woof or any
article of skin that you wash, it should then be washed a second time, and it
will be clean. 59 “This is the law of the disease of leprosy in a garment of
wool or of linen, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin,
for declaring it clean or unclean.“ |14| Jehovah continued to speak to
Moses, saying: 2 “This is to be the law of the leper on the day his
purification is established, when he is to be brought to the priest. 3 The
priest will go outside the camp and examine him. If the leper has been cured
of the leprosy, 4 the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds,
cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop for his cleansing. 5 The priest will
command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running
water. 6 But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood, the
scarlet material, and the hyssop, and dip them together in the blood of the
bird that was killed over the running water. 7 Then he will spatter it seven
times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean, and
he will set the living bird free in the open field. 8 “The one cleansing
himself must wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water,
and he will be clean. Afterward, he may come into the camp, but he will dwell
outside his tent for seven days. 9 On the seventh day, he should shave off all
the hair on his head and his chin and his eyebrows. After he shaves off all
his hair, he will wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and he will be
clean. 10 “On the eighth day, he will take two sound young rams, one sound
female lamb in its first year, three tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed
with oil as a grain offering, and one log measure of oil; 11 and the priest
who declares him clean will present the man who is cleansing himself, along

with the offerings, before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 12
The priest will take the one young ram and offer it as a guilt offering
together with the log measure of oil, and he will wave them back and forth as
a wave offering before Jehovah. 13 Then he will slaughter the young ram in the
place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are usually slaughtered,
in a holy place, because, like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to
the priest. It is something most holy. 14 “Then the priest will take some of
the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest will put it on the right
earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on
the big toe of his right foot. 15 And the priest will take some of the log
measure of oil and pour it into his own left palm. 16 The priest will then dip
his right finger into the oil that is in his left palm and spatter some of the
oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah. 17 Then the priest will put
some of the remaining oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one
cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his
right foot over the blood of the guilt offering. 18 The priest will put what
is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself,
and the priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah. 19 “The priest
will sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one cleansing
himself from his impurity, and afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering.
20 And the priest will offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on
the altar, and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean. 
21 “However, if he is poor and does not have enough means, he will then take
one young ram as a guilt offering for a wave offering, in order to make
atonement for himself, along with one tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed
with oil as a grain offering, a log measure of oil, 22 and two turtledoves or
two young pigeons, according to his means. The one will serve as a sin
offering, and the other as a burnt offering. 23 On the eighth day, he will
bring them for establishing his purification to the priest at the entrance of
the tent of meeting before Jehovah. 24 “The priest will take the young ram
of the guilt offering and the log measure of oil, and the priest will wave
them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 25 He will then
slaughter the young ram of the guilt offering, and the priest will take some
of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one
cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his
right foot. 26 The priest will pour some of the oil into his own left palm, 27
and he will then spatter with his right finger some of the oil that is in his
left palm seven times before Jehovah. 28 And the priest will put some of the
oil that is in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and
on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot on the
same places that he put the blood of the guilt offering. 29 The priest will
then put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one
cleansing himself, in order to make atonement for him before Jehovah. 30 “He
will offer up one of the turtledoves or one of the young pigeons, according to
his means, 31 the one he can afford, as a sin offering and the other as a
burnt offering along with the grain offering; and the priest will make
atonement for the one cleansing himself before Jehovah. 32 “This is the law
for the one in whom the disease of leprosy was but who does not have the means
when establishing his purification.“ 33 Then Jehovah said to Moses and
Aaron: 34 “When you come into the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving you as
a possession, and I contaminate a house in your land with the disease of
leprosy, 35 the one to whom the house belongs should then come and tell the

                                       112

Leviticus 14

priest, ‘Some kind of contamination has appeared in my house.’ 36 The
priest will give orders to clear out the house before he comes to examine the
contamination, in order that he may not declare everything that is in the
house unclean; and after that the priest will come in to inspect the house. 37
He will examine the affected area, and if the walls of the house are
contaminated with yellowish-green or reddish depressions and they appear to be
deeper than the wall surface, 38 the priest will then go out of the house to
the entryway of the house and quarantine the house for seven days. 39 “Then
the priest will return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the
contamination has spread in the walls of the house, 40 the priest will then
give orders, and the contaminated stones must be torn out and thrown outside
the city into an unclean place. 41 Then he is to have the inside of the house
thoroughly scraped, and the plaster and mortar that is removed should be
discarded outside the city in an unclean place. 42 They will then insert other
stones in the place of the stones they removed, and he should use different
mortar and have the house plastered. 43 “If, though, the contamination
returns and breaks out in the house after the stones were torn out and the
house was scraped and replastered, 44 the priest will then go in and inspect
it. If the contamination has spread in the house, it is malignant leprosy in
the house. The house is unclean. 45 He will then have the house pulled
down—its stones, its timbers, and all the plaster and mortar of the
house—and carried outside the city to an unclean place. 46 But whoever
enters the house any of the days it is quarantined will be unclean until the
evening; 47 and whoever lies down in the house should wash his garments, and
whoever eats in the house should wash his garments. 48 “However, if the
priest comes and sees that the contamination has not spread in the house after
the house was replastered, the priest will then declare the house clean,
because the contamination has been healed. 49 In order to purify the house
from uncleanness, he will take two birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and
hyssop. 50 He is to kill the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running
water. 51 Then he will take the cedarwood, the hyssop, the scarlet material,
and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in
the running water, and he must spatter it toward the house seven times. 52 And
he will purify the house from uncleanness with the blood of the bird, the
running water, the live bird, the cedarwood, the hyssop, and the scarlet
material. 53 He will then set the live bird free outside the city in the open
field and make atonement for the house, and it will be clean. 54 “This is
the law respecting any case of leprosy, infection of the scalp or the beard, 
55 leprosy of the garment or the house, 56 and respecting swellings, scabs,
and blotches, 57 in order to determine when something is unclean and when
something is clean. This is the law about leprosy.“ |15| Jehovah continued
to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell
them, ‘If a man has a discharge from his genital organ, this discharge makes
him unclean. 3 He is unclean from the discharge, whether the discharge
continues to flow from his genitals or is obstructed, he is still unclean. 4
“‘Any bed that the one with the discharge lies on will be unclean, and
anything he sits on will be unclean. 5 A man who touches his bed must wash his
garments, and he should bathe in water and be unclean until the evening. 6
Anyone who sits on an article that the one having a discharge sat on should
wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 7 Whoever
touches the flesh of the one having a discharge should wash his garments,
bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 8 If the one who has a

                                       113

Leviticus 15

discharge spits on someone clean, that person must wash his garments, bathe in
water, and be unclean until the evening. 9 Any saddle that the one with the
discharge rides on will be unclean. 10 Anyone touching anything that was under
him will be unclean until the evening, and anyone who carries those items will
wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 11 If the
one with the discharge has not washed his hands in water and he touches
someone, that person must then wash his garments, bathe in water, and be
unclean until the evening. 12 An earthenware vessel that the one having a
discharge touches should be smashed, and any wooden vessel should be washed
with water. 13 “‘When the discharge stops and the person becomes clean
from it, he will then count seven days for his purification, and he must wash
his garments, bathe himself in running water, and he will be clean. 14 On the
eighth day, he should take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come
before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the
priest. 15 And the priest will offer them, the one as a sin offering and the
other as a burnt offering, and the priest will make atonement for him before
Jehovah concerning his discharge. 16 “‘Now if a man has an emission of
semen, he should bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until the
evening. 17 He must wash with water any garment and any skin with semen on it,
and it will be unclean until the evening. 18 “‘When a man lies with a
woman and has an emission of semen, they should bathe in water and be unclean
until the evening. 19 “‘If a woman has a discharge of blood from her body,
she will continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days. Anyone touching
her will be unclean until the evening. 20 Anything she lies down on in her
menstrual impurity will be unclean, and everything she sits on will be
unclean. 21 Anyone touching her bed should wash his garments, bathe in water,
and be unclean until the evening. 22 Anyone touching any article she sat on
should wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 23
If she sat on the bed or on another article, his touching it will make him
unclean until the evening. 24 And if a man lies down with her and her
menstrual impurity comes on him, he will then be unclean for seven days, and
any bed on which he lies down will be unclean. 25 “‘When a woman’s
discharge of blood flows for many days when it is not the regular time of her
menstruation, or if she should have a flow longer than her usual menstruation,
she will be unclean during all the days of her discharge, as in the days of
her menstrual impurity. 26 Any bed she lies on during the days of her
discharge will become like the bed of her menstrual impurity, and any article
she sits on will become unclean like the uncleanness of her menstrual
impurity. 27 Anyone touching them will be unclean, and he must wash his
garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 28 “‘However,
when she is clean from her discharge, she will count for herself seven days,
and afterward she will be clean. 29 On the eighth day, she should take two
turtledoves or two young pigeons, and she will bring them to the priest at the
entrance of the tent of meeting. 30 The priest will make the one a sin
offering and the other a burnt offering, and the priest will make atonement
for her before Jehovah concerning her unclean discharge. 31 “‘Thus you
must keep the Israelites separate from their uncleanness, so that they do not
die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle, which is in their midst. 
32 “‘This is the law about the man having a discharge, the man who is
unclean because of an emission of semen, 33 the woman during her menstrual
impurity, any male or female who has a discharge flowing from the body, and a
man who lies down with an unclean woman.’“ |16| Jehovah spoke to Moses

Leviticus 16

after the death of Aaron’s two sons who died for approaching Jehovah. 2
Jehovah said to Moses: “Tell Aaron your brother that he may not come at just
any time into the holy place inside the curtain, in front of the cover on the
Ark, so that he may not die, for I will appear over the cover in a cloud. 3
“This is what Aaron should bring when he comes into the holy place: a young
bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 4 He should put on the
holy linen robe, and the linen shorts should cover his body, and he should
wrap himself with the linen sash and his head with the linen turban. They are
holy garments. He will bathe himself in water and put them on. 5 “He should
take from the assembly of the Israelites two young male goats for a sin
offering and one ram for a burnt offering. 6 “Aaron must then present the
bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and he will make atonement in
behalf of himself and his house. 7 “He will then take the two goats and make
them stand before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 8 Aaron will
draw lots over the two goats, the one lot for Jehovah and the other lot for
A·zaʹzel. 9 Aaron will present the goat that was designated by lot for
Jehovah and make it a sin offering. 10 But the goat designated by lot for
A·zaʹzel should be brought alive to stand before Jehovah in order to perform
the atonement upon it, so that it may be sent away for A·zaʹzel into the
wilderness. 11 “Aaron will present the bull of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and make atonement in behalf of himself and his house; afterward
he will slaughter the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself. 12 “He
will then take the fire holder full of burning coals from the altar before
Jehovah and two handfuls of fine perfumed incense, and he will bring them
inside the curtain. 13 He will also put the incense on the fire before
Jehovah, and the cloud of the incense will envelop the Ark cover, which is on
the Testimony, so that he may not die. 14 “He will take some of the bull’s
blood and spatter it with his finger in front of the cover on the east side,
and he will spatter some of the blood with his finger seven times before the
cover. 15 “He will then slaughter the goat of the sin offering, which is for
the people, and bring its blood inside the curtain and do with its blood the
same as he did with the bull’s blood; he is to spatter it toward the cover
and before the cover. 16 “He must make atonement for the holy place
concerning the acts of uncleanness of the Israelites and concerning their
transgressions and their sins, and that is what he should do for the tent of
meeting, which is located among them in the midst of their acts of
uncleanness. 17 “No other man should be in the tent of meeting from the time
he goes in to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out. He will
make atonement in behalf of himself and his house and in behalf of the entire
congregation of Israel. 18 “He will then come out to the altar, which is
before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and he will take some of the
bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on the horns of the
altar on all sides. 19 He will also spatter some of the blood on it with his
finger seven times and cleanse it and sanctify it from the acts of uncleanness
of the Israelites. 20 “When he has finished making atonement for the holy
place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he will also present the live
goat. 21 Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and
confess over it all the errors of the Israelites and all their transgressions
and all their sins, and he will put them on the head of the goat and send it
away into the wilderness by the hand of a man designated to do this. 22 The
goat will carry upon itself all their errors into a desert land, and he will
send the goat away into the wilderness. 23 “Aaron will then enter into the

                                       115

Leviticus 16

tent of meeting and take off the linen garments that he put on when he went
into the holy place, and he will lay them down there. 24 He must bathe himself
in water in a holy place and put on his garments; then he will come out and
offer up his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering and make
atonement in his own behalf and in behalf of the people. 25 He will make the
fat of the sin offering smoke on the altar. 26 “The man who sent away the
goat for A·zaʹzel should wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and
after that he may come into the camp. 27 “And the bull of the sin offering
and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the holy place
to make atonement, will be taken outside the camp, and their skins and their
flesh and their dung will be burned in the fire. 28 The one who burns them
should wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and after that he may
come into the camp. 29 “It will serve as a lasting statute for you: In the
seventh month, on the tenth of the month, you should afflict yourselves, and
you must not do any work, whether a native or a foreigner who is residing
among you. 30 On this day atonement will be made for you, to declare you
clean. You will be clean from all your sins before Jehovah. 31 It is a sabbath
of complete rest for you, and you should afflict yourselves. It is a lasting
statute. 32 “The priest who is anointed and installed to serve as priest in
place of his father will make atonement and put on the linen garments, the
holy garments. 33 He will make atonement for the holy sanctuary, the tent of
meeting, and the altar; and he will make atonement for the priests and for all
the people of the congregation. 34 This will serve as a lasting statute for
you, to make atonement for the Israelites concerning all their sins once each
year.“
So he did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. |17| Jehovah went on
to say to Moses: 2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and
say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah has commanded: 3 “‘“If any man of
the house of Israel slaughters a bull or a young ram or a goat in the camp or
if he slaughters it outside the camp, 4 instead of bringing it to the entrance
of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to Jehovah before the
tabernacle of Jehovah, bloodguilt will be counted to that man. He has shed
blood, and that man must be cut off from among his people. 5 This is so that
the Israelites will bring the sacrifices, which they now sacrifice in the open
field, to Jehovah, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest. They
are to sacrifice these as communion sacrifices to Jehovah. 6 And the priest
will sprinkle the blood on Jehovah’s altar at the entrance of the tent of
meeting and make the fat smoke as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 7 So they
should no longer offer sacrifices to the goatlike demons, with which they are
prostituting themselves. This will serve as a lasting statute for you
throughout your generations.“’ 8 “You should say to them, ‘Any man of
the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst who offers
up a burnt offering or a sacrifice 9 and does not bring it to the entrance of
the tent of meeting to offer it to Jehovah must be cut off from his people. 10
“‘If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in
your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the
one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people. 11
For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I myself have given it on the
altar for you to make atonement for yourselves, because it is the blood that
makes atonement by means of the life in it. 12 That is why I have said to the
Israelites: “None of you should eat blood, and no foreigner who is residing
in your midst should eat blood.“ 13 “‘If one of the Israelites or some
foreigner who is residing in your midst is hunting and catches a wild animal

                                       116

Leviticus 17

or a bird that may be eaten, he must pour its blood out and cover it with
dust. 14 For the life of every sort of flesh is its blood, because the life is
in it. Consequently, I said to the Israelites: “You must not eat the blood
of any sort of flesh because the life of every sort of flesh is its blood.
Anyone eating it will be cut off.“ 15 If anyone, whether a native or a
foreigner, eats an animal found dead or one torn by a wild animal, he must
then wash his garments and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening;
then he will be clean. 16 But if he does not wash them and does not bathe
himself, he will answer for his error.’“ |18| Jehovah continued to speak
to Moses, saying: 2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘I am
Jehovah your God. 3 You must not behave as they do in the land of Egypt, where
you were dwelling, and you must not do what they do in the land of Caʹnaan,
where I am bringing you. And you must not walk in their statutes. 4 You should
carry out my judicial decisions, and you should keep my statutes and walk in
them. I am Jehovah your God. 5 You must keep my statutes and my judicial
decisions; anyone who does so will live by means of them. I am Jehovah. 6
“‘No man among you should approach any of his close relatives to have
sexual relations. I am Jehovah. 7 You must not have sexual relations with your
father, and you must not have sexual relations with your mother. She is your
mother, and you must not have sexual relations with her. 8 “‘You must not
have sexual relations with your father’s wife. It is exposing your father to
shame. 9 “‘You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either the
daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother, whether she is born in
the same household or born outside of it. 10 “‘You must not have sexual
relations with the daughter of your son or the daughter of your daughter,
because they are your own nakedness. 11 “‘You must not have sexual
relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, the offspring of your
father, because she is your sister. 12 “‘You must not have sexual
relations with your father’s sister. She is your father’s blood relative. 
13 “‘You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister,
because she is your mother’s blood relative. 14 “‘You must not expose
your father’s brother to shame by having sexual relations with his wife. She
is your aunt. 15 “‘You must not have sexual relations with your
daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife, and you must not have relations
with her. 16 “‘You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s
wife, because it is exposing your brother to shame. 17 “‘You must not have
sexual relations with a woman and her daughter. You must not take the daughter
of her son and the daughter of her daughter in order to have relations. They
are her close relatives; it is an obscene act. 18 “‘You must not take a
woman in addition to her sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with
her while her sister is alive. 19 “‘You must not approach a woman during
her menstrual impurity to have sexual relations with her. 20 “‘You must
not have sexual intercourse with the wife of your fellow man, making yourself
unclean. 21 “‘You must not allow any of your offspring to be offered to
Moʹlech. You must not profane the name of your God in that way. I am Jehovah.
22 “‘You must not lie down with a male in the same way that you lie down
with a woman. It is a detestable act. 23 “‘A man must not have sexual
intercourse with an animal to become unclean by it; nor should a woman offer
herself to an animal to have intercourse with it. It is a violation of what is
natural. 24 “‘Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for
it is by all these things that the nations that I am driving out from before
you have made themselves unclean. 25 Therefore, the land is unclean, and I

                                       117

Leviticus 18

will bring punishment on it for its error, and the land will vomit its
inhabitants out. 26 But you yourselves must keep my statutes and my judicial
decisions, and you must not do any of these detestable things, whether a
native or a foreigner who is residing among you. 27 For all these detestable
things were done by the men who lived in the land before you, and now the land
is unclean. 28 Then the land will not have to vomit you out for defiling it in
the same way that it will vomit out the nations that were before you. 29 If
anyone does any of these detestable things, all those doing them must be cut
off from among their people. 30 You must keep your obligation to me by not
practicing any of the detestable customs that were carried on before you, so
that you do not make yourselves unclean by them. I am Jehovah your God.’“ 
|19| Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 “Speak to the entire assembly
of the Israelites and tell them, ‘You should be holy, because I, Jehovah
your God, am holy. 3 “‘Each of you should respect his mother and his
father, and you should keep my sabbaths. I am Jehovah your God. 4 Do not turn
to worthless gods or make for yourselves gods of cast metal. I am Jehovah your
God. 5 “‘Now if you offer a communion sacrifice to Jehovah, you should
sacrifice it in such a way that you gain approval for yourselves. 6 It should
be eaten on the day of your sacrifice and on the next day, but what is left
over until the third day should be burned in the fire. 7 If, though, any of it
is eaten on the third day, it is an offensive thing that will not be accepted
with approval. 8 The one eating it will answer for his error because he has
profaned a holy thing of Jehovah, and that person must be cut off from his
people. 9 “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not reap the
edge of your field completely and you must not pick up the gleaning of your
harvest. 10 Also, you must not gather the leftovers of your vineyard or pick
up the scattered grapes of your vineyard. You should leave them for the poor
and the foreign resident. I am Jehovah your God. 11 “‘You must not steal,
you must not deceive, and you must not deal falsely with one another. 12 You
must not swear to a lie in my name and thus profane the name of your God. I am
Jehovah. 13 You must not defraud your fellow man, and you must not rob. You
should not withhold the wages of a hired worker all night until morning. 14
“‘You must not curse a deaf man or put an obstacle before a blind man, and
you must be in fear of your God. I am Jehovah. 15 “‘You must not be unjust
in your judgment. You must not show partiality to the poor or show preference
to the rich. With justice you should judge your fellow man. 16 “‘You must
not go around spreading slander among your people. You must not stand up
against the life of your fellow man. I am Jehovah. 17 “‘You must not hate
your brother in your heart. You should by all means reprove your fellow man,
so that you will not bear sin along with him. 18 “‘You must not take
vengeance nor hold a grudge against the sons of your people, and you must love
your fellow man as yourself. I am Jehovah. 19 “‘You should keep my
statutes: You must not interbreed two sorts of your domestic animals. You must
not sow your field with two sorts of seed, and you must not wear a garment
made with two sorts of thread mixed together. 20 “‘Now if a man lies down
with a woman and has intercourse with her and she is a servant who is
designated for another man, but she has not been redeemed or given her
freedom, there should be a punishment. However, they should not be put to
death, for she was not yet set free. 21 He should bring his guilt offering to
Jehovah to the entrance of the tent of meeting, a ram of guilt offering. 22
The priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering
before Jehovah for the sin that he committed, and he will be forgiven for the

                                       118

Leviticus 19

sin that he committed. 23 “‘When you come into the land and you plant any
tree for food, you must consider its fruitage impure and forbidden. For three
years it will be forbidden to you. It must not be eaten. 24 But in the fourth
year, all its fruit will be holy for rejoicing before Jehovah. 25 Then in the
fifth year, you may eat its fruit in order to add its produce to your harvest.
I am Jehovah your God. 26 “‘You must eat nothing containing
blood.
“‘You must not look for omens or practice magic. 27 “‘You must
not shave the hair on the side of your head or disfigure the edges of your
beard. 28 “‘You must not make cuts in your flesh for a dead person, and
you must not make tattoo markings on yourselves. I am Jehovah. 29 “‘Do not
dishonor your daughter by making her a prostitute, so that the land may not
commit prostitution and be filled with loose morals. 30 “‘You must keep my
sabbaths, and you must show reverence for my sanctuary. I am Jehovah. 31
“‘Do not turn to the spirit mediums, and do not consult fortune-tellers so
as to become unclean by them. I am Jehovah your God. 32 “‘Before gray hair
you should rise up, and you must show honor to an older man, and you must be
in fear of your God. I am Jehovah. 33 “‘If a foreigner resides with you in
your land, you must not mistreat him. 34 The foreigner who resides with you
should become to you like a native among you; and you must love him as
yourself, for you were foreign residents in the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah
your God. 35 “‘You must not use dishonest standards in measuring length,
weight, or volume. 36 You should use accurate scales, accurate weights, an
accurate dry measure, and an accurate liquid measure. I am Jehovah your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 37 So you must keep all my statutes
and all my judicial decisions, and you must follow them. I am Jehovah.’“ 
|20| Jehovah went on speaking to Moses, saying: 2 “You are to say to the
Israelites, ‘Any man of Israel and any foreigner who resides in Israel who
gives any of his offspring to Moʹlech should be put to death without fail.
The people of the land should stone him to death. 3 I myself will set my face
against that man, and I will cut him off from among his people, because he has
given some of his offspring to Moʹlech and has defiled my holy place and has
profaned my holy name. 4 If the people of the land should deliberately close
their eyes to what that man does when he gives his offspring to Moʹlech and
they do not put him to death, 5 then I myself will certainly set my face
against that man and his family. I will cut off that man from his people along
with all who join him in prostituting themselves to Moʹlech. 6 “‘As for
the person who turns to the spirit mediums and the fortune-tellers so as to
commit spiritual prostitution with them, I will certainly turn against that
person and cut him off from his people. 7 “‘You must sanctify yourselves
and become holy, because I am Jehovah your God. 8 And you must keep my
statutes and carry them out. I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying you. 9 “‘If
there is any man who curses his father or his mother, he should be put to
death without fail. Since he has cursed his father or his mother, his own
blood is upon him. 10 “‘Now regarding a man who commits adultery with
another man’s wife: The one who commits adultery with the wife of his fellow
man should be put to death without fail, the adulterer and the adulteress. 11
A man who lies down with his father’s wife has exposed his father to shame.
Both of them should be put to death without fail. Their own blood is upon
them. 12 If a man lies down with his daughter-in-law, both of them should be
put to death without fail. They have violated what is natural. Their own blood
is upon them. 13 “‘If a man lies down with a male the same as one lies
down with a woman, both of them have done a detestable thing. They should be

                                       119

Leviticus 20

put to death without fail. Their own blood is upon them. 14 “‘If a man
takes a woman and her mother, it is an obscene act. They should burn him and
them in the fire, so that obscene conduct may not continue among you. 15
“‘If a man has intercourse with a beast, he should be put to death without
fail, and you should kill the beast. 16 If a woman approaches any beast to
have intercourse with it, you must kill the woman and the beast. They should
be put to death without fail. Their own blood is upon them. 17 “‘If a man
has sexual relations with his sister, the daughter of his father or the
daughter of his mother, and he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness,
it is a disgrace. They must be cut off before the eyes of the sons of their
people. He has exposed his sister to shame. He should answer for his error. 18
“‘If a man lies down with a menstruating woman and has sexual relations
with her, both he and she have exposed her flow of blood. Both of them must be
cut off from among their people. 19 “‘You must not have sexual relations
with your mother’s sister or your father’s sister, because that would be
exposing a blood relative to shame. They should answer for their error. 20 A
man who lies down with his uncle’s wife has exposed his uncle to shame. They
should answer for their sin. They should die childless. 21 If a man takes his
brother’s wife, it is something abhorrent. He has exposed his brother to
shame. They should become childless. 22 “‘You must keep all my statutes
and all my judicial decisions and carry them out, so that the land where I am
bringing you to dwell will not vomit you out. 23 You must not walk in the
statutes of the nations that I am driving out from before you; for they have
done all these things and I abhor them. 24 That is why I said to you: “You
will take possession of their land, and I will give it to you as your
possession, a land flowing with milk and honey. Jehovah your God I am, who has
set you apart from the peoples.“ 25 You must make a distinction between the
clean animal and the unclean and between the unclean bird and the clean; you
must not make yourselves loathsome by means of an animal or a bird or anything
that creeps on the ground that I set apart for you to regard as unclean. 26
You must be holy to me, because I, Jehovah, am holy, and I am setting you
apart from the peoples to become mine. 27 “‘Any man or woman who acts as a
spirit medium or is a fortune-teller should be put to death without fail. The
people should stone them to death. Their own blood is upon them.’“ |21|
Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “Talk to the priests, Aaron’s sons, and
say to them, ‘No one should defile himself for a dead person among his
people. 2 But he may do so for a close blood relative, for his mother, his
father, his son, his daughter, his brother, 3 and he may defile himself for
his sister if she is a virgin who is near to him and has not yet married. 4 He
may not defile himself and make himself profane for a woman who belongs to a
husband of his people. 5 They should not make their heads bald or shave off
the fringe of their beard or make cuts on their body. 6 They should be holy to
their God, and they should not profane the name of their God, for they are
presenting Jehovah’s offerings made by fire, the bread of their God, and
they must be holy. 7 They should not marry a prostitute, a woman who has been
defiled, or a woman divorced from her husband, because the priest is holy to
his God. 8 You must sanctify him, because he is one presenting the bread of
your God. He should be holy to you, because I, Jehovah, the one sanctifying
you, am holy. 9 “‘Now if the daughter of a priest should profane herself
by committing prostitution, she is profaning her father. She should be burned
in the fire. 10 “‘The high priest of his brothers, on whose head the
anointing oil is poured and who has been installed to wear the priestly

                                       120

Leviticus 21

garments, should not let his head go ungroomed or tear his garments. 11 He
should not approach any dead person; he may not defile himself even for his
father or his mother. 12 He should not go out from the sanctuary and should
not profane the sanctuary of his God, for the sign of dedication, the
anointing oil of his God, is upon him. I am Jehovah. 13 “‘He must take as
a wife a woman who is a virgin. 14 He may not marry a widow, a divorced woman,
one who has been defiled, or a prostitute; but he should take a virgin from
his people as a wife. 15 He should not profane his offspring among his people,
for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying him.’“ 16 Jehovah continued to speak
to Moses, saying: 17 “Tell Aaron, ‘No man of your offspring throughout
their generations who has a defect may approach to present the bread of his
God. 18 If there is any man who has a defect, he may not approach: a man who
is blind or lame or has a disfigured face or one limb too long, 19 a man with
a fractured foot or a fractured hand, 20 a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man with
an eye defect or eczema or ringworm or damaged testicles. 21 No man of the
offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect may approach to present
Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. Because he has a defect, he may not
approach to present the bread of his God. 22 He may eat the bread of his God
from the most holy things and from the holy things. 23 However, he may not
come near the curtain, and he may not approach the altar, because there is a
defect in him; and he should not profane my sanctuary, for I am Jehovah, who
is sanctifying them.’“ 24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons and all the
Israelites. |22| Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 “Tell Aaron and
his sons that they should be careful how they handle the holy things of the
Israelites and not profane my holy name regarding the things they are
sanctifying to me. I am Jehovah. 3 Say to them, ‘Throughout your
generations, any of your offspring who, while he is unclean, comes near to the
holy things that the Israelites sanctify to Jehovah, that person will be cut
off from before me. I am Jehovah. 4 No man of Aaron’s offspring who has
leprosy or a discharge may eat of the holy things until he becomes clean,
neither the man who touches someone who became unclean by a dead person, nor a
man who has a seminal emission, 5 nor a man who touches an unclean swarming
creature or who touches a man who is unclean for any reason and who can make
him unclean. 6 The person who touches any of these will be unclean until the
evening and may not eat any of the holy things, but he should bathe himself in
water. 7 When the sun has set, he will be clean, and afterward he may eat some
of the holy things because it is his food. 8 Also, he should not eat any
animal found dead or anything torn by wild animals and become unclean by it. I
am Jehovah. 9 “‘They must keep their obligation to me, so that they may
not incur sin because of it and have to die for it because they were profaning
it. I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying them. 10 “‘No unauthorized person may
eat anything holy. No foreign guest of a priest or hired worker may eat
anything holy. 11 But if a priest should purchase someone with his own money,
that person may share in eating it. Slaves born in his house may also share in
eating his food. 12 If the daughter of a priest should marry someone who is
not a priest, she may not eat of the contribution of the holy things. 13 But
if the daughter of a priest should become a widow or is divorced and she has
no offspring and she returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she may
eat some of her father’s food; but no unauthorized person may eat it. 14
“‘Now if a man eats a holy thing by mistake, he must add a fifth of its
value and give the holy offering to the priest. 15 So they should not profane
the holy things of the Israelites that they contribute to Jehovah 16 and cause

                                       121

Leviticus 22

them to incur punishment for their guilt because of eating their holy things;
for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying them.’“ 17 Jehovah continued speaking
to Moses, saying: 18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and
say to them, ‘When an Israelite man or a foreign resident in Israel presents
a burnt offering to Jehovah to fulfill his vows or to make a voluntary
offering, 19 he should present a sound male from the herd, the young rams, or
the goats, in order to gain approval. 20 You must not present anything with a
defect, for it will not serve to gain approval for you. 21 “‘If a man
presents a communion sacrifice to Jehovah to pay a vow or as a voluntary
offering, it should be a sound animal from the herd or the flock, in order to
gain approval. No defect at all should be in it. 22 No offering should be
blind, have a fracture, a cut, a wart, scabbiness, or ringworm; you must not
present any of these to Jehovah or make such an offering on the altar for
Jehovah. 23 You may present a bull or a sheep with a limb that is too long or
too short as a voluntary offering, but it will not be accepted with approval
as a vow offering. 24 You must not present to Jehovah one having the testicles
damaged or crushed or pulled off or cut off, and you should not offer such
animals in your land. 25 And you must not present any of these from the hand
of a foreigner as the bread of your God, for they are corrupted and defective.
They will not be accepted with approval for you.’“ 26 Jehovah spoke
further to Moses, saying: 27 “When a bull or a young ram or a goat is born,
it will continue with its mother for seven days, but from the eighth day
forward it will be accepted with approval as an offering, an offering made by
fire to Jehovah. 28 As for a bull or a sheep, you must not slaughter it and
its young on the same day. 29 “If you sacrifice a thanksgiving sacrifice to
Jehovah, you should sacrifice it to gain approval for yourselves. 30 It should
be eaten on that day. You must not leave any of it until morning. I am
Jehovah. 31 “You must keep my commandments and carry them out. I am Jehovah.
32 You must not profane my holy name, and I must be sanctified in the midst of
the Israelites. I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying you, 33 the one bringing you
out of the land of Egypt to prove myself God to you. I am Jehovah.“ |23|
Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying: 2 “Speak to the Israelites and
tell them, ‘The seasonal festivals of Jehovah that you should proclaim are
holy conventions. These are my seasonal festivals: 3 “‘Six days work may
be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy
convention. You may not do any sort of work. It is to be a sabbath to Jehovah
wherever you dwell. 4 “‘These are the seasonal festivals of Jehovah, holy
conventions that you should proclaim at the times appointed for them: 5 In the
first month, on the 14th day of the month, at twilight is the Passover to
Jehovah. 6 “‘On the 15th day of this month is the Festival of Unleavened
Bread to Jehovah. Seven days you should eat unleavened bread. 7 On the first
day, you will observe a holy convention. You should not do any hard work. 8
But you are to present an offering made by fire to Jehovah for seven days.
There will be a holy convention on the seventh day. You should not do any hard
work.’“ 9 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 10 “Speak to the
Israelites and tell them, ‘When you eventually come into the land that I am
giving you and you have reaped its harvest, you must bring a sheaf of the
firstfruits of your harvest to the priest. 11 And he will wave the sheaf back
and forth before Jehovah to gain approval for you. The priest should wave it
on the day after the Sabbath. 12 On the day you have the sheaf waved, you must
offer a sound young ram in its first year, as a burnt offering to Jehovah. 13
Its grain offering will be two tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with

                                       122

Leviticus 23

oil, as an offering made by fire to Jehovah, a pleasing aroma. Its drink
offering will be a fourth of a hin of wine. 14 You must not eat any bread,
roasted grain, or new grain until this day, until you bring the offering of
your God. It is a lasting statute for all your generations wherever you dwell.
15 “‘You are to count seven sabbaths from the day after the Sabbath, from
the day that you bring the sheaf of the wave offering. They should be complete
weeks. 16 You will count off 50 days until the day after the seventh Sabbath,
and then you should present a new grain offering to Jehovah. 17 You should
bring from your dwelling places two loaves as a wave offering. These should be
made of two tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour. They should be baked with
leaven, as first ripe fruits to Jehovah. 18 And you should present along with
the loaves seven sound male lambs, each a year old, and one young bull and two
rams. They will serve as a burnt offering to Jehovah along with the
corresponding grain offering and drink offerings, as an offering made by fire,
of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 19 And you must offer one young goat as a sin
offering and two male lambs, each a year old, as a communion sacrifice. 20 The
priest will wave them back and forth along with the loaves of the first ripe
fruits, as a wave offering before Jehovah, together with the two male lambs.
They should serve as something holy to Jehovah for the priest. 21 On this day
you will make a proclamation for a holy convention for yourselves. You may not
do any hard work. It is a lasting statute in all your dwelling places for all
your generations. 22 “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you must
not reap the edge of your field completely and you should not pick up what is
left from your harvest. You should leave it for the poor and for the foreign
resident. I am Jehovah your God.’“ 23 Jehovah went on speaking to Moses,
saying: 24 “Tell the Israelites, ‘In the seventh month, on the first of
the month, you should observe a complete rest, a memorial signaled by a
trumpet blast, a holy convention. 25 You may not do any hard work, and you
will present an offering made by fire to Jehovah.’“ 26 Jehovah spoke
further to Moses, saying: 27 “However, on the tenth of this seventh month is
the Day of Atonement. You should observe a holy convention, and you must
afflict yourselves and present an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 28 You are
not to do any sort of work on this particular day because it is a day of
atonement to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God. 29 Anyone who
will not afflict himself on this day will be cut off from his people. 30 And I
will destroy from among his people every person who does any sort of work on
this day. 31 You must not do any sort of work. It is a lasting statute for all
your generations wherever you dwell. 32 It is a sabbath of complete rest for
you, and you will afflict yourselves on the ninth of the month in the evening.
You should observe your sabbath from evening to evening.“ 33 Jehovah
continued speaking to Moses, saying: 34 “Tell the Israelites, ‘On the 15th
day of this seventh month is the Festival of Booths for seven days to Jehovah.
35 There is to be a holy convention on the first day, and you should not do
any hard work. 36 Seven days you must present an offering made by fire to
Jehovah. On the eighth day, you should observe a holy convention, and you
should present an offering made by fire to Jehovah. It is a solemn assembly.
You may not do any hard work. 37 “‘These are the seasonal festivals of
Jehovah that you should proclaim as holy conventions for presenting an
offering made by fire to Jehovah: the burnt offering and the grain offering of
the sacrifice and the drink offerings according to the daily schedule. 38
These are in addition to what is offered on Jehovah’s sabbaths, and your
gifts, your vow offerings, and your voluntary offerings, which you should give

to Jehovah. 39 However, on the 15th day of the seventh month, when you have
gathered the produce of the land, you should celebrate the festival of Jehovah
for seven days. On the first day is a complete rest and on the eighth day is a
complete rest. 40 On the first day, you will take the fruit of majestic trees,
the fronds of palm trees, the branches of leafy trees and poplars of the
valley, and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days. 41 You
will celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah for seven days in the year. As a
lasting statute during all your generations, you should celebrate it in the
seventh month. 42 You should dwell in the booths for seven days. All the
natives in Israel should dwell in the booths, 43 so that your future
generations may know that it was in the booths that I made the Israelites
dwell when I was bringing them out of the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah your
God.’“ 44 So Moses spoke of the seasonal festivals of Jehovah to the
Israelites. |24| Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 “Command the
Israelites to bring to you pure, beaten olive oil for the lights, to keep the
lamps lit constantly. 3 Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the tent of
meeting, Aaron should arrange to keep the lamps lit from evening to morning
before Jehovah constantly. It is a permanent statute for all your generations.
4 He should set the lamps in order on the lampstand of pure gold before
Jehovah constantly. 5 “You will take fine flour and bake it into 12
ring-shaped loaves. Two tenths of an eʹphah should go into each loaf. 6 You
will place them in two sets of layers, six to the layer set, on the table of
pure gold before Jehovah. 7 You should put pure frankincense on each layer
set, and it will serve as the bread for a token offering made by fire to
Jehovah. 8 On each Sabbath day, he should regularly arrange it before Jehovah.
It is a lasting covenant with the Israelites. 9 It will become Aaron’s and
his sons’, and they will eat it in a holy place, because it is something
most holy for him from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire, as a lasting
regulation.“ 10 Now among the Israelites was a son of an Israelite woman and
an Egyptian man, and a fight broke out between him and an Israelite man in the
camp. 11 The son of the Israelite woman began to abuse the Name and to curse
it. So they brought him to Moses. Incidentally, his mother was She·loʹmith,
the daughter of Dibʹri of the tribe of Dan. 12 They placed him in custody
until Jehovah’s decision was made clear to them. 13 Then Jehovah said to
Moses: 14 “Bring the one who cursed to the outside of the camp, and all
those who heard him must lay their hands on his head, and then the entire
assembly must stone him. 15 And you should tell the Israelites, ‘If any man
curses his God, he will answer for his sin. 16 So the abuser of Jehovah’s
name should be put to death without fail. The entire assembly should stone him
without fail. The foreign resident should be put to death the same as the
native for his abusing the Name. 17 “‘If a man takes a human life, he
should be put to death without fail. 18 Anyone who strikes and kills a
domestic animal should make compensation for it, life for life. 19 If a man
injures his fellow man, then what he has done should be done to him. 20
Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, the same sort of injury
he inflicted should be inflicted on him. 21 The man who strikes and kills an
animal should make compensation for it, but the one who strikes and kills a
man should be put to death. 22 “‘One judicial decision will apply for you,
whether a foreign resident or a native, because I am Jehovah your God.’“ 
23 Moses then spoke to the Israelites, and they brought the one who uttered
the curse to the outside of the camp, and they stoned him. Thus the Israelites
did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. |25| Jehovah spoke further to Moses

                                       124

Leviticus 25

on Mount Siʹnai, saying: 2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When
you eventually come into the land that I am giving you, then the land will
observe a sabbath to Jehovah. 3 Six years you should sow your field with seed,
and six years you should prune your vineyard, and you will gather the land’s
produce. 4 But in the seventh year, there should be a sabbath of complete rest
for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah. You should not sow your field with seed or
prune your vineyard. 5 You must not reap what grows on its own from the grain
left after the harvest, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you must not
gather. There should be a year of complete rest for the land. 6 However, you
may eat the food that grows in the land during its sabbath; you, your male and
female slaves, your hired worker, and the foreign settlers who are residing
with you may eat it, 7 as well as the domestic and the wild animals in your
land. Everything the land produces may be eaten. 8 “‘You will count off
seven sabbath years, seven times seven years, and the days of the seven
sabbath years will amount to 49 years. 9 You will then sound the horn loudly
in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month; on the Day of Atonement, you
should cause the sound of the horn to be heard in all your land. 10 You must
sanctify the 50th year and proclaim liberty in the land to all its
inhabitants. It will become a Jubilee for you, and each of you will return to
his property and each of you should return to his family. 11 A Jubilee is what
that 50th year will become for you. You will not sow seed or reap what grew on
its own from leftover grain nor gather the grapes of unpruned vines. 12 For it
is a Jubilee. It is to be holy to you. You may eat only what the land produces
by itself. 13 “‘In this year of the Jubilee, each of you should return to
his property. 14 If you sell anything to your fellow man or if you buy from
him, do not exploit one another. 15 You should buy from your fellow man,
taking into account the number of the years after the Jubilee, and he should
sell to you according to the remaining years for crops. 16 If there are many
years remaining, he may increase its purchase price, and when there are few
years left, he should reduce its purchase price, because he is selling you the
number of crops to be produced. 17 No one among you should exploit his fellow
man, and you must be in fear of your God, for I am Jehovah your God. 18 By
your carrying out my statutes and keeping my judicial decisions, you will
dwell in security in the land. 19 The land will give its fruitage, and you
will eat to satisfaction and dwell there in security. 20 “‘But if you
should say: “What will we eat in the seventh year if we may not sow seed or
gather our crops?“ 21 I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year,
and the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years. 22 Then you will
sow seed in the eighth year and eat from the old crop until the ninth year.
Until its crop arrives, you will eat from the old. 23 “‘The land should
not be sold on a permanent basis, because the land is mine. For you are
foreign residents and settlers from my standpoint. 24 Throughout the land of
your possession, you should grant the right of buying back the land. 25
“‘If your brother becomes poor and has to sell some of his property, a
repurchaser who is closely related to him must come and buy back what his
brother sold. 26 If anyone has no repurchaser but he becomes prosperous and
finds the means to repurchase it, 27 he should calculate its value for the
years since he sold it and refund the difference to the man whom he sold it
to. Then he may return to his property. 28 “‘But if he does not find the
means to get it back from him, what he sold will remain with the purchaser
until the Jubilee year; and it will revert to him in the Jubilee, and he will
return to his property. 29 “‘Now if a man should sell a home in a walled

                                       125

Leviticus 25

city, his right of repurchase will also continue until the end of the year
from the time of his completing the sale; his right of repurchase will be
valid a whole year. 30 But if it is not bought back by the end of one full
year, the house within the walled city will become the permanent property of
its purchaser throughout his generations. It should not be released in the
Jubilee. 31 However, the houses of settlements with no surrounding wall should
be considered to be part of the field of the countryside. The right of
repurchase should continue for it, and it should be released in the Jubilee. 
32 “‘As for the houses of the Levites within their cities, the Levites
will have the permanent right to repurchase them. 33 When the property of the
Levites is not bought back, the house sold in the city belonging to them will
also be released in the Jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the
Levites are their property among the Israelites. 34 Moreover, the field of
pasture ground surrounding their cities may not be sold, for it is their
permanent possession. 35 “‘If your brother who is nearby becomes poor and
cannot support himself, you must sustain him as you would a foreign resident
and a settler, so that he may keep alive with you. 36 Do not take interest or
make a profit from him. You must be in fear of your God, and your brother will
keep alive with you. 37 You must not lend him your money on interest or give
out your food for profit. 38 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the
land of Egypt to give you the land of Caʹnaan, to prove myself your God. 39
“‘If your brother who lives nearby becomes poor and he has to sell himself
to you, you must not force him to do slave labor. 40 He should be treated like
a hired worker, like a settler. He should serve with you until the Jubilee
year. 41 Then he will leave you, he and his children with him, and return to
his family. He should return to the property of his forefathers. 42 For they
are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They should not sell
themselves the way a slave is sold. 43 You must not treat him cruelly, and you
must be in fear of your God. 44 Your male and female slaves are to come from
the nations around you, from them you may buy a male or a female slave. 45
Also from the sons of the foreign settlers who are residing with you, from
them and from their families that are born to them in your land you may buy
slaves, and they will become your possession. 46 You may pass them on as an
inheritance to your sons after you to inherit as a permanent possession. You
may use them as workers, but you must not subject your Israelite brothers to
cruel treatment. 47 “‘But if a foreign resident or a settler among you
becomes wealthy and your brother has become poor alongside him and must sell
himself to the foreign resident or the settler who lives among you, or to a
member of the family of the foreign resident, 48 he will continue to have the
right of repurchase after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may buy him
back, 49 or his uncle or the son of his uncle may buy him back, or any close
relative, one of his family, may buy him back.
“‘Or if he himself has
become wealthy, he may also buy himself back. 50 He should calculate with his
purchaser the time from the year he sold himself to him until the Jubilee
year, and the money of his sale will correspond to the number of years. His
workdays during that time will be assessed at the rate of a hired worker. 51
If there are many years remaining, he should pay his repurchase price in
proportion to the years that are left. 52 But if only a few years remain until
the Jubilee year, he should then calculate for himself and pay his repurchase
price in proportion to the years remaining. 53 He should continue to serve him
year by year as a hired worker; and you should see to it that he does not
treat him cruelly. 54 However, if he cannot buy himself back on these terms,

he will then go free in the year of Jubilee, he and his children with him. 55
“‘For the Israelites are my own slaves. They are my slaves whom I brought
out of the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God. |26| “‘You must not make
worthless gods for yourselves, and you must not set up a carved image or a
sacred pillar for yourselves, and you must not put a stone figure in your land
in order to bow down toward it; for I am Jehovah your God. 2 You should keep
my sabbaths and show reverence for my sanctuary. I am Jehovah. 3 “‘If you
continue walking in my statutes and keeping my commandments and you carry them
out, 4 I will give you showers of rain at their proper time, and the land will
yield its produce, and the trees of the field will give their fruit. 5 Your
threshing season will extend until your grape harvest, and the grape harvest
will extend until the sowing season; and you will eat your bread to
satisfaction and dwell in security in your land. 6 I will put peace in the
land, and you will lie down with no one making you afraid; and I will rid the
land of vicious wild animals, and a sword of war will not pass through your
land. 7 You will certainly pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you
by the sword. 8 Five of you will pursue 100, and 100 of you will pursue
10,000, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword. 9 “‘I will
direct my favor to you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will keep
my covenant with you. 10 While you are still eating the old produce of the
preceding year, you will need to clear out the old to make way for the new. 11
And I will place my tabernacle in your midst, and I will not reject you. 12 I
will walk among you and be your God, and you for your part will be my people. 
13 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be their
slaves no longer, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk with
heads held high. 14 “‘However, if you will not listen to me or keep all
these commandments, 15 and if you reject my statutes, and if you abhor my
judicial decisions so that you do not keep all my commandments, and you
violate my covenant, 16 I, for my part, will do the following to you: I will
punish you with distress, with tuberculosis and burning fever, making your
eyes fail and your life waste away. You will sow your seed simply for nothing,
for your enemies will eat it. 17 I will set my face against you, and you will
be defeated by your enemies; and those who hate you will tread on you, and you
will flee when no one is pursuing you. 18 “‘If even this does not make you
listen to me, I will have to chastise you seven times as much for your sins. 
19 I will break your stubborn pride and make your heavens like iron and your
earth like copper. 20 You will exhaust your strength for nothing, as your land
will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not produce fruit. 
21 “‘But if you keep walking in opposition to me and refuse to listen to
me, I will then have to strike you seven times as much, according to your
sins. 22 I will send the wild animals of the field among you, and they will
bereave you of children and annihilate your domestic animals and reduce your
numbers, and your roads will be deserted. 23 “‘If in spite of these things
you do not accept my correction and you insist on walking in opposition to me,
24 then I too will walk in opposition to you, and I myself will strike you
seven times for your sins. 25 I will bring an avenging sword upon you for
breaking the covenant. If you gather yourselves into your cities, I will send
disease into your midst, and you will be given into the hand of an enemy. 26
When I destroy your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread
in only one oven and then ration your bread by weight; and you will eat but
you will not be satisfied. 27 “‘If in spite of this you will not listen to
me and you insist on walking in opposition to me, 28 I will intensify my

                                       127

Leviticus 26

opposition to you, and I myself will have to chastise you seven times for your
sins. 29 So you will have to eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the
flesh of your daughters. 30 I will annihilate your sacred high places and cut
down your incense stands and pile your carcasses on the carcasses of your
disgusting idols, and I will turn away from you in disgust. 31 I will give
your cities to the sword and make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not
smell the pleasing aromas of your sacrifices. 32 I myself will make the land
desolate, and your enemies who are dwelling in it will stare in amazement over
it. 33 And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe a sword
after you; and your land will be made desolate, and your cities will be
devastated. 34 “‘At that time the land will pay off its sabbaths all the
days it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time
the land will rest, as it must repay its sabbaths. 35 All the days it lies
desolate it will rest, because it did not rest during your sabbaths when you
were dwelling on it. 36 “‘As for those who survive, I will fill their
hearts with despair in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a blowing
leaf will cause them to flee, and they will flee like someone running from the
sword and fall without anyone pursuing them. 37 They will stumble over one
another like those running from a sword, though no one is pursuing them. You
will not be able to resist your enemies. 38 You will perish among the nations,
and the land of your enemies will consume you. 39 Those of you who remain will
be left to rot in the lands of your enemies because of your error. Yes, they
will rot away because of the errors of their fathers. 40 Then they will
confess their own error and the error and unfaithfulness of their fathers and
admit that they behaved unfaithfully by walking in opposition to me. 41 Then I
also walked in opposition to them by bringing them into the land of their
enemies.
“‘Perhaps then their uncircumcised heart will be humbled, and
then they will pay off their error. 42 And I will remember my covenant with
Jacob, and my covenant with Isaac, and I will remember my covenant with
Abraham, and I will remember the land. 43 While the land was abandoned by
them, it was paying off its sabbaths and lying desolate without them, and they
were paying for their error, because they rejected my judicial decisions and
they abhorred my statutes. 44 But despite all of this, while they are in the
land of their enemies, I will never completely reject them nor cast them away
to the point of exterminating them, which would violate my covenant with them,
for I am Jehovah their God. 45 For their sakes I will remember the covenant
with their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt under the eyes of
the nations, in order to prove myself their God. I am Jehovah.’“ 46 These
are the regulations, the judicial decisions, and the laws that Jehovah
established between himself and the Israelites on Mount Siʹnai through Moses.
|27| Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 “Speak to the Israelites
and tell them, ‘If a man makes a special vow to offer the estimated value of
a person to Jehovah, 3 the estimated value of a male from 20 to 60 years old
will be 50 shekels of silver by the standard shekel of the holy place. 4 But
if it is a female, the estimated value will be 30 shekels. 5 If the age is
from 5 to 20 years old, the estimated value of the male will be 20 shekels and
10 shekels for the female. 6 If the age is from one month up to five years
old, the estimated value of the male will be five shekels of silver and three
shekels of silver for the female. 7 “‘If the age is 60 years and over, the
estimated value will be 15 shekels for the male and 10 shekels for the female.
8 But if he is too poor to pay the estimated value, the person will stand
before the priest, and the priest will set a value on him. The priest will

                                       128

---

Leviticus 27

make the valuation according to what the one making the vow can afford. 9
“‘If the vow involves an animal that is suitable for offering to Jehovah,
whatever may be given to Jehovah will become something holy. 10 He may not
replace it or exchange it with good for bad or with bad for good. But if he
should exchange it with one animal for another animal, the original and what
is exchanged for it will both become holy. 11 If it is an unclean animal that
may not be presented as an offering to Jehovah, he will then stand the animal
before the priest. 12 The priest will then set its value, as to whether it is
good or bad. The value estimated by the priest will stand. 13 But if he ever
wants to buy it back, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to the
estimated value. 14 “‘Now if a man should sanctify his house as something
holy to Jehovah, the priest will then set its value, whether it is good or
bad. According to the value that the priest sets, that is what it will cost. 
15 But if the one who sanctifies his house wants to buy it back, he must then
give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it, and it
will become his. 16 “‘If a man sanctifies to Jehovah some of the field
that he possesses, the value will be estimated in proportion to the seed
needed to sow it: a hoʹmer of barley seed will be 50 shekels of silver. 17 If
he sanctifies his field from the year of Jubilee, the estimated value stands. 
18 If he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate for
him the price in proportion to the years that are left until the next year of
Jubilee, and a deduction should be made from the estimated value. 19 But if
the one who sanctified it should ever buy the field back, he must then give a
fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it, and it will
remain his. 20 Now if he should not buy the field back and the field is sold
to another man, it may not be bought back again. 21 When the field is released
in the Jubilee, it will become something holy to Jehovah, as a field that is
devoted to him. It will become the property of the priests. 22 “‘If a man
sanctifies to Jehovah a field he purchased that is not part of his hereditary
property, 23 the priest will calculate for him the amount of the valuation up
until the year of Jubilee, and he will give the estimated value on that day.
It is something holy to Jehovah. 24 In the year of Jubilee, the field will
return to the one he bought it from, to the one the land belongs to. 25
“‘Every value should be estimated by the standard shekel of the holy
place. The shekel should amount to 20 geʹrahs. 26 “‘However, no one
should sanctify the firstborn of the animals, since it is born as the
firstborn for Jehovah. Whether bull or sheep, it already belongs to Jehovah. 
27 If it is among the unclean animals and he redeems it according to the
estimated value, he should give a fifth of it in addition to it. But if it is
not bought back, it will be sold according to the estimated value. 28
“‘But no devoted thing that a man devotes unconditionally to Jehovah from
his belongings may be sold or bought back, whether from mankind or animals or
the field he possesses. Every devoted thing is something most holy to Jehovah.
29 Furthermore, no condemned person who is set apart for destruction may be
redeemed. He should be put to death without fail. 30 “‘Every tenth part of
the land, whether from the produce of the field or the fruit of the trees,
belongs to Jehovah. It is something holy to Jehovah. 31 If a man ever wants to
buy any of his tenth part back, he should give a fifth of it in addition to
it. 32 As for every tenth part of the herd and flock, everything that passes
under the shepherd’s staff, the tenth animal should become something holy to
Jehovah. 33 He should not examine whether it is good or bad, neither should he
exchange it. But if he would ever try to exchange it, both the original and

                                       129

what is exchanged for it should become something holy. It may not be bought
back.’“ 34 These are the commandments that Jehovah gave to Moses for the
Israelites on Mount Siʹnai. 


Song_of_Solomon

|1| The song of songs, which is Solʹo·mon’s: 2 “May he kiss me with the
kisses of his mouth,For your expressions of affection are better than wine. 3
The fragrance of your oils is pleasant.
Your name is like a fragrant oil
poured out.
That is why the young women love you. 4 Take me with you; let us
run.
The king has brought me into his interior rooms!
Let us be joyful and
rejoice in you.
Let us praise your expressions of affection more than
wine.
Rightly they love you. 5 I am dark, but lovely, O daughters of
Jerusalem,Like the tents of Keʹdar, like the tent cloths of Solʹo·mon. 6 Do
not stare at me because I am swarthy,Because the sun has gazed upon me.
The
sons of my mother were angry with me;They appointed me the keeper of the
vineyards,But my own vineyard I did not keep. 7 Tell me, you whom I love so
much,Where you pasture your flock,Where you have them lie down at midday.
Why
should I be like a woman wrapped in a veilAmong the flocks of your
companions?“ 8 “If you do not know, O most beautiful of women,Go follow
the tracks of the flockAnd pasture your young goats next to the tents of the
shepherds.“ 9 “I liken you, my beloved, to a mare among the chariots of
Pharʹaoh. 10 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,Your neck with strings of
beads. 11 We will make for you gold ornamentsStudded with silver.“ 12
“While the king sits at his round table,My perfume gives off its fragrance. 
13 My dear one is to me like a fragrant bag of myrrhSpending the night between
my breasts. 14 My dear one is to me like a cluster of hennaAmong the vineyards
of En-gedʹi.“ 15 “Look! You are beautiful, my beloved.
Look! You are
beautiful. Your eyes are those of doves.“ 16 “Look! You are beautiful, my
dear one, and delightful.
Our bed is among the foliage. 17 The beams of our
house are cedars,Our rafters are juniper trees. |2| “I am but a saffron of
the coastal plain,A lily of the valleys.“ 2 “Like a lily among thornsIs my
beloved among the daughters.“ 3 “Like an apple tree among the trees of the
forest,So is my dear one among the sons.
I passionately desire to sit in his
shade,And his fruit is sweet to my taste. 4 He brought me into the banquet
house,And his banner over me was love. 5 Refresh me with raisin cakes;Sustain
me with apples,For I am lovesick. 6 His left hand is under my head,And his
right hand embraces me. 7 I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,By
the gazelles and the does of the field:
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in
me until it feels inclined. 8 The sound of my dear one!
Look! Here he
comes,Climbing the mountains, leaping over the hills. 9 My dear one is like a
gazelle, like a young stag.
There he is, standing behind our wall,Gazing
through the windows,Looking through the lattices. 10 My dear one speaks, he
says to me:
‘Rise up, my beloved,My beautiful one, come away with me. 11
Look! The winter has passed.
The rains are over and gone. 12 Blossoms have
appeared in the land,The time of pruning has arrived,And the song of the
turtledove is heard in our land. 13 The fig tree ripens its early figs;The
vines are in blossom and give off their fragrance.
Rise up, my beloved, and
come.
My beautiful one, come away with me. 14 O my dove, in the retreats of
the crag,In the recesses of the cliff,Let me see you and hear your voice,For
your voice is pleasant and your appearance is lovely.’“ 15 “Catch the
foxes for us,The little foxes that ruin the vineyards,For our vineyards are in
bloom.“ 16 “My dear one is mine and I am his.
He is shepherding among the
lilies. 17 Until the day grows breezy and the shadows flee,Return quickly, O
my dear one,Like the gazelle or the young stag upon the mountains of
separation. |3| “Upon my bed during the nights,I sought the one I love.

sought him, but I did not find him. 2 I will arise and roam the city;In the
streets and in the public squares,Let me seek the one I love.
I sought him,
but I did not find him. 3 The watchmen making their rounds in the city found
me.
‘Have you seen the one I love?’ 4 Scarcely had I passed by themWhen I
found the one I love.
I held on to him, I would not let him goUntil I brought
him into my mother’s house,Into the interior room of her who conceived me. 5
I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,By the gazelles and the does of
the field:
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels
inclined.“ 6 “What is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of
smoke,Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,With all the fragrant powders of a
merchant?“ 7 “Look! It is the couch belonging to Solʹo·mon.
Sixty mighty
men surround it,Of the mighty men of Israel, 8 All of them armed with a
sword,All trained in warfare,Each with his sword at his sideTo guard against
the terrors of the night.“ 9 “It is the royal litter of King
Solʹo·monThat he made for himself from the trees of Lebʹa·non. 10 Its
pillars he made of silver,Its supports of gold.
Its seat is of purple wool;Its
interior was lovingly decoratedBy the daughters of Jerusalem.“ 11 “Go out,
O daughters of Zion,Gaze at King Solʹo·monWearing the wedding crown his
mother made for himOn the day of his marriage,On the day of his heart’s
rejoicing.“ |4| “Look! You are beautiful, my beloved.
Look! You are
beautiful.
Your eyes are those of doves behind your veil.
Your hair is like a
flock of goatsStreaming down the mountains of Gilʹe·ad. 2 Your teeth are
like a flock of newly shorn sheepThat have come up from being washed,All of
them bearing twins,And not one has lost her young. 3 Your lips are like a
scarlet thread,And your speech is delightful.
Like a segment of pomegranateAre
your cheeks behind your veil. 4 Your neck is like the tower of David,Built
with courses of stoneUpon which are hung a thousand shields,All the circular
shields of the mighty men. 5 Your two breasts are like two fawns,The twins of
a gazelle,That feed among the lilies.“ 6 “Until the day grows breezy and
the shadows flee,I will go my way to the mountain of myrrhAnd to the hill of
frankincense.“ 7 “You are altogether beautiful, my beloved,There is no
blemish in you. 8 Come with me from Lebʹa·non, my bride,Come with me from
Lebʹa·non.
Descend from the peak of A·maʹnah,From the peak of Seʹnir, the
peak of Herʹmon,From the lairs of lions, from the mountains of leopards. 9
You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride,You have captured my heart
with one glance of your eyes,With one pendant of your necklace. 10 How
beautiful your expressions of affection are, my sister, my bride!
Your
expressions of affection are far better than wine,And the fragrance of your
perfume than any spice! 11 Your lips, my bride, drip with comb honey.
Honey
and milk are under your tongue,And the fragrance of your garments is like the
fragrance of Lebʹa·non. 12 My sister, my bride, is like a locked garden,A
locked garden, a spring sealed shut. 13 Your shoots are a paradise of
pomegranatesWith the choicest fruits, with henna along with spikenard plants, 
14 Spikenard and saffron, cane and cinnamon,With all sorts of trees of
frankincense, myrrh, and aloes,Along with all the finest perfumes. 15 You are
a garden spring, a well of fresh water,And flowing streams from Lebʹa·non. 
16 Awake, O north wind;Come in, O south wind.
Breathe upon my garden.
Let its
fragrance spread.“
“Let my dear one come into his gardenAnd eat its
choicest fruits.“ |5| “I have entered my garden,O my sister, my bride.
I
have picked my myrrh and my spice.
I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;I
have drunk my wine and my milk.“
“Eat, dear friends!
Drink and become
intoxicated with expressions of affection!“ 2 “I am asleep, but my heart

is awake.
There is the sound of my dear one knocking!
‘Open to me, O my
sister, my beloved,My dove, my flawless one!
For my head is wet with dew,The
locks of my hair with the moisture of the night.’ 3 I have taken off my
robe.
Must I put it back on?
I have washed my feet.
Must I soil them again? 4
My dear one withdrew his hand from the hole of the door,And my feelings for
him were stirred. 5 I got up to open to my dear one;My hands dripped with
myrrh,And my fingers with liquid myrrh,Onto the handles of the lock. 6 I
opened to my dear one,But my dear one had turned away, he had gone.
I felt
despair when he departed.
I sought him, but I did not find him.
I called him,
but he did not answer me. 7 The watchmen making their rounds in the city found
me.
They struck me, they wounded me.
The watchmen of the walls took my shawl
away from me. 8 I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem:
If you find my
dear one,Tell him that I am lovesick.“ 9 “How is your dear one better than
any other dear one,You most beautiful of women?
How is your dear one better
than any other dear one,That you put us under such an oath?“ 10 “My dear
one is dazzling and ruddy;He stands out among ten thousand. 11 His head is
gold, the finest gold.
The locks of his hair are like waving palm fronds,As
black as the raven. 12 His eyes are like doves by streams of water,Bathing
themselves in milk,Sitting by a brimming pool. 13 His cheeks are like a bed of
spices,Mounds of scented herbs.
His lips are lilies, dripping with liquid
myrrh. 14 His hands are cylinders of gold, set with chrysʹo·lite.
His
abdomen is polished ivory covered with sapphires. 15 His legs are pillars of
marble set on pedestals of the finest gold.
His appearance is like
Lebʹa·non, as unrivaled as the cedars. 16 His mouth is sweetness itself,And
everything about him is desirable.
This is my dear one, this is my beloved, O
daughters of Jerusalem.“ |6| “Where has your dear one gone,O most
beautiful of women?
Which way did your dear one turn?
Let us seek him with
you.“ 2 “My dear one has gone down to his garden,To the beds of spice
plants,To shepherd among the gardensAnd to pick lilies. 3 I am my dear
one’s,And my dear one is mine.
He is shepherding among the lilies.“ 4
“You are as beautiful as Tirʹzah, my beloved,As lovely as Jerusalem,As
breathtaking as armies around their banners. 5 Turn your eyes away from me,For
they overwhelm me.
Your hair is like a flock of goatsStreaming down the slopes
of Gilʹe·ad. 6 Your teeth are like a flock of sheepThat have come up from
being washed,All of them bearing twins,And not one has lost her young. 7 Like
a segment of pomegranateAre your cheeks behind your veil. 8 There may be 60
queensAnd 80 concubinesAnd young women without number. 9 But only one is my
dove, my flawless one.
The only one of her mother.
She is the favorite of the
one who bore her.
The daughters see her, and they pronounce her happy;Queens
and concubines, and they praise her. 10 ‘Who is she who shines like the
dawn,As beautiful as the full moon,As pure as the sunlight,As breathtaking as
armies around their banners?’“ 11 “I went down to the garden of nut
treesTo see the new growth in the valley,To see whether the vine had
sprouted,Whether the pomegranate trees had blossomed. 12 Before I knew it,My
desire had put meAt the chariots of my noble people.“ 13 “Return, return,
O Shuʹlam·mite!
Return, return,That we may look upon you!“
“Why do you
gaze upon the Shuʹlam·mite?“
“She is like the dance of two companies!“
|7| “How beautiful your feet are in your sandals,O noble daughter!
The
curves of your thighs are like ornaments,The work of an artisan’s hands. 2
Your navel is a round bowl.
May it never lack mixed wine.
Your belly is a heap
of wheat,Encircled by lilies. 3 Your two breasts are like two fawns,The twins
of a gazelle. 4 Your neck is like an ivory tower.
Your eyes are like the pools

in Heshʹbon,By the gate of Bath-rabʹbim.
Your nose is like the tower of
Lebʹa·non,Which looks toward Damascus. 5 Your head crowns you like
Carʹmel,And the locks of your hair are like purple wool.
The king is
captivated by the flowing tresses. 6 How beautiful you are, and how pleasant
you are,O beloved girl, above all exquisite delights! 7 Your stature is like a
palm tree,And your breasts are like date clusters. 8 I said, ‘I will climb
the palm treeTo take hold of its stalks of fruit.’
May your breasts be like
clusters of grapes,Your breath as fragrant as apples, 9 And your mouth like
the best wine.“
“May it go down smoothly for my dear one,Softly flowing
over the lips of those asleep. 10 I am my dear one’s,And his desire is for
me. 11 Come, O my dear one,Let us go out to the fields;Let us lodge among the
henna plants. 12 Let us rise early and go to the vineyardsTo see if the vine
has sprouted,If the blossoms have opened,If the pomegranates are in
bloom.
There I will express my affection for you. 13 The mandrakes give off
their fragrance;At our doors are all sorts of choice fruits.
The new as well
as the old,O my dear one, I have kept in store for you. |8| “If only you
were like my brother,Who nursed at my mother’s breasts!
Then if I found you
outside, I would kiss you,And no one would despise me. 2 I would lead you;I
would bring you into the house of my mother,She who taught me.
I would give
you spiced wine to drink,The fresh juice of pomegranates. 3 His left hand
would be under my head,And his right hand would embrace me. 4 I put you under
oath, O daughters of Jerusalem:
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me
until it feels inclined.“ 5 “Who is this coming up from the
wilderness,Leaning upon her dear one?“
“Under the apple tree I awakened
you.
There your mother was in labor with you.
There she who gave birth to you
was in labor. 6 Place me as a seal upon your heart,As a seal upon your arm,For
love is as strong as death is,And exclusive devotion is as unyielding as the
Grave.
Its flames are a blazing fire, the flame of Jah. 7 Surging waters
cannot extinguish love,Nor can rivers wash it away.
If a man would offer all
the wealth of his house for love,It would be utterly despised.“ 8 “We have
a little sister,And she has no breasts.
What will we do for our sisterOn the
day when she is spoken for?“ 9 “If she is a wall,We will build upon her a
battlement of silver,But if she is a door,We will board her up with a cedar
plank.“ 10 “I am a wall,And my breasts are like towers.
So in his eyes I
have becomeAs one who finds peace. 11 Solʹo·mon had a vineyard in
Baʹal-haʹmon.
He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers.
Each one would bring
in a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit. 12 I have my own vineyard at my
disposal.
The thousand pieces of silver belong to you, O Solʹo·mon,And two
hundred to those who care for its fruit.“ 13 “O you who are dwelling in
the gardens,The companions listen for your voice.
Let me hear it.“ 14
“Hurry, my dear one,And be swift like a gazelleOr a young stagUpon the
mountains of spices.“
